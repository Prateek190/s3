0,2018-01-11,Nestle,"Italian Nutella maker Ferrero SpA is nearing a deal to acquire Nestle SA’s U.S. confectionery business for about $2.8 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter.

An agreement could be signed as early as Sunday, the person said, asking not to be identified as the information is private. The business, which includes the Butterfinger and Baby Ruth brands, is suffering a decline in revenue and had sales of about 900 million francs ($915 million) in 2016.

Ferrero, which has traditionally shied away from acquisitions, is expanding its portfolio beyond Nutella hazelnut spread, Tic Tac candies and Ferrero Rocher chocolates. For Nestle, the world’s largest food company, this marks Chief Executive Officer Mark Schneider’s first major divestment and an initial step away from chocolate.

Nestle and Ferrero declined to comment.

The move shows closely held Ferrero is eyeing a bigger bite of the U.S. market after buying Ferrara Candy in December. That boosted its market share in that country to 4.8 percent.

Last month, Hershey Co., which has been named as one of the potential bidders, agreed to pay $921 million for Amplify Snack Brands Inc., to expand into popcorn and potato chips.

Nestle plans to focus on categories like coffee and pet food as the industry grapples with a drop in demand for sugary products. While the Swiss company has been moving toward healthier fare, it’s holding on to its prepared-dishes, ice cream and global confectionery businesses. Those product categories made up roughly 40 percent of total sales last year.

Nestle shares fell 1.4 percent Wednesday in Zurich.

The Swiss KitKat maker said in June it was considering options for the unit, and in December said it expected to sell the business in the first quarter of 2018."
1,2018-01-12,Nestle,"NEW DELHI:French foods maker Danone is exiting its dairy portfolio in India, seven years after it entered the category dominated by Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF)-owned Amul and Mother Dairy, besides Nestle and Britannia. While India is the world’s largest producer and consumer of dairy, Danone’s dairy business could not compete with bigger players and has remained a non-starter.

Danone’s fresh dairy portfolio in India included dahi, mishti dahi and flavoured yoghurts, and the UHT portfolio comprised of UHT Milk, buttermilk, lassi, cold coffee and smoothies. A company spokesperson confirmed the development. “Danone has decided to rationalise its product portfolio in India to allow for accelerated investments and a sharper focus on growing its nutrition portfolio which is more than 90% of the business, and where the company already enjoys leadership position,” the spokesperson said.

Danone had entered the dairy business after breaking up its troubled joint venture with Britannia in 2010. Its factory at Rai near Delhi manufacturing discontinued products will stop production. Danone’s other factory in Punjab, manufacturing infant nutrition products will continue to function, the company said.

Danone will exit products which have been making a minority contribution to its overall business in India which include the UHT and fresh dairy products. “We have great ambitions for our business in India and remain committed to invest and grow in India through well-established brands such as Protinex, Aptamil, Farex, Dexolac and Neocate.”"

I hold 20 shares of Capital First at Rs 702 for long term. Kindly advise. — UMMED SOLANKI

The merger proposal of Capital First with IDFC Bank is at around 12 per cent premium for Capital First as per the last Friday’s closing prices. Also post-merger, the valuation multiple for the combined entity would be still be comparatively cheaper as compared to other new private sector banks. Hence, hold the stock for the long term.


I have 100 shares of ITC at Rs 262.50. How long do I have to hold it to make money? — PS RANA
You may have to hold beyond one to two years to get any significant profits from ITC as the cigarette business is likely to continue to face adversary tax environment and its other FMCG (other than cigarettes) is yet to show any significant profit growth.


I have got 5,000 shares of Sintex Industries at an average price of Rs 33 per share after its de-merger. Please suggest whether it will reach Rs 60? — TEJINDER SINGH
Hold Sintex with a target price of around Rs30. I doubt whether it can touch your target price of Rs60 even in the next three years considering its balance sheet status.


I bought 4,000 shares of Udaipur Cements at Rs 31.85. Please advise what to do? — HARMESH ARORA

This loss-making cement company is fairly priced in terms of enterprise value to cement capacity also. Hence, you may consider selling it if it rises another 5 per cent to 10 per cent.


I hold 1,000 Cummins India bought at Rs 974.50, 1,000 Shiva Cement bought at Rs 34.70 and 700 Sintex Plastics at Rs 85.40 for past few months now. Planning to keep for a year or so. — P KULKARNI

Sell Cummins India if you recover the cost as at that price it would be valued around 34PE on FY19 expected earnings. You may hold Shiva Cement as JSW Cement has consolidated its holding in it. Plastic producers would have a tough time in near future as crude oil prices have shot up. Hence, sell Sintex Platsics even if it recovers 5 per cent from its crash on last Friday.


I have 500 shares each of REC and NBCC at Rs 160 and Rs 260. What to do. — PRAMOD AHUJA
Hold REC as it trades at discount to book value – it could give at least 10 per cent return in the short term from the current price. Sell NBCC around Rs 275 as it trades at quite stretched valuation of around 27 PE on FY2019 expected earnings.


I have 638 of RIL at Rs 528, 33 shares of Nestle at Rs 6,300, 450 of HPCL and 400 shares of IOC. I am a longterm investor, please advise. — HARI OM MITTAL
Hold all of them. Firm resource prices and expansion projects of petchem business augur well for RIL. Moreover, the management’s vision to make RIL the world’s 20th largest company means a lot of efforts in terms of both organic and inorganic routes to grow the company. Both HPCL and IOC would continue to grow as rising automobile population would help them to consistently grow their fuel retailing business. Nestle, though trades at stretched valuation, its solid brands and defensive business model provide a lot of comfort to the long-term investors.

2,2018-02-11,Nestle,"NEW DELHI: The domestic equity market witnessed highly volatile trade during the week gone by. Selloff on Wall Street amid fears of rising inflation, higher interest rates and a spike in US Treasury yields engulfed stock markets globally, including in India.

On Friday, the S&P BSE Sensex shed 407 points to close at 34,006 while the broader Nifty50 index of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) lost over 1 per cent, or 122 points, to settle at 10,455. On a weekly basis, the Nifty50 lost 2.84 per cent while the 30-share Sensex pack declined 3.02 per cent.

Among key highlights of the week, RBI kept the repo rate unchanged in its sixth bimonthly money policy review on Wednesday while maintaining a neutral stance. However, it did flag concerns on inflation.

From the earnings corner, country's largest public sector lender SBI took everyone by surprise when it reported a massive quarterly loss on the back of a spike in provisions towards bad loan and hardening of bond yields, which led to treasury losses. On the other hand, steel giant Tata Steel's Q3 net jumped five-fold to Rs 1,136 crore from Rs 232 crore reported for same period last year.

Here's a look at the events and triggers that may decide market direction next week. The market will remain closed on Tuesday, February 13, 2018, on account of Mahashivratri.


Global cues hold keyMovement in US stocks and in Asian markets will be watched keenly. On Friday, US equities ended higher, but posted their worst weekly loss in two years.

Nifty may rally when volatility easesNifty's recent gap-down openings suggested fear among the traders, but post such openings, the market did not witness follow-through selling at least for that day, said Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in. ""This kind of behaviour points to some accumulation at intraday low points. Hence, there will be a higher possibility of a rally once volatility subsides in global financial markets,"" Mazhar added. Chandan Taparia of Motilal Oswal Securities said if the index manages to cross and hold above 10,500, a bounceback towards 10,600 and 10,650 levels cannot be ruled out.

TWEET OF THE DAY

4,2018-02-12,Nestle,"Dear friends! It's great to have you at ETMarkets Evening Podcast.

This is Abhinav Kaul and I will bring you a round-up of what all happened during the day's trading, with views and insights from market mavens. 

It was a relief rally after a brutal week, with both headline indices signing off the day in style. Asian shares got back on their feet and Wall Street in the US too extended its bounce. 

Market participants are still playing their cards with care, given a new 10 per cent long-term capital gains tax and fears of a central bank rate hike. 

Volatility index, the fear parameter, jumped 7 per cent, suggesting that the danger of liquidity -- or rather lack of it -- still lurks. 

The Nifty index closed higher 0.81 per cent at 10,540. The BSE Sensex added 295 points, or 0.87 per cent, to close at 34,300. Pharma, financial and capital goods took the centre-stage.

The Nifty formed a small bullish candle on the daily chart. Experts believe that only a further extension to the buying momentum on Wednesday morning may instil confidence among traders. 

The market is shut on Tuesday for Mahashivratri.

We have with us Sanjiv Bhasin, executive VP for markets and corporate affairs at IIFL to shares his view on the factors that gave direction to market on Monday. 

Byte 1: Sanjiv Bhasin

Nestle India registered the biggest jump in open interest at 34.56 per cent. Bank of Baroda stood second with 19.10 per cent and SBI third at 19.07 per cent.

The company’s promoter Neeraj Singal has meanwhile questioned the whole process of auctioning off defaulting steel companies through NCLT (National Company Law Tribunal). 


Nestle India: The shares rallied 9 per cent for the week after the FMCG major reported nearly 60 per cent spike in its fourth-quarter net profit, driven by a strong volume growth that also pushed its 2017 revenue beyond the Rs 10,000-crore mark. The Indian arm of Switzerland-based Nestle, which makes the Maggi instant noodles and KitKat chocolates, posted a profit of Rs 312 crore for the quarter ended December 2017, compared to Rs 195 crore a year earlier.


GVK Power: This firm fell 12 per cent for the week. There were reports that the company will raise up to $1 billion by issuing dollar bonds to fund greenfield projects and refinance existing debt. Besides, the company told the BSE that it entered into an agreement with Anagha Constructions and Visakha Constructions to sell and transfer the entire equity stake in three of its smaller subsidiaries.


Fortis Healthcare: It took a beating following the Supreme Court ruling that allowed lenders of the company to sell shares pledged with them by promoters Malvinder and Shivinder Singh. Five lenders – Yes Bank, Axis Bank, RBL, ECL Finance and Indiabulls Housing Finance – hold such pledged shares. The stock was down 7.3 per cent for the week.


GMR Infra: This stock tanked 6.7 per cent for the week after the company reported a consolidated net loss of Rs 565.94 crore for the quarter ended December 2017. The company had clocked a net profit of Rs 643.44 crore in the same quarter of 2016-17, it said in a BSE filing."
12,2018-02-23,Nestle,"Corporate karma. Suresh Narayanan, chairman, Nestlé India, believes that what goes around, comes around — a belief that helped him in the 2015 crisis.

 Suresh Narayanan, chairman, Nestlé India, has been vocal about how he kept his morale high when the company was going through a turmoil in 2015.

 A random test on a sample of the company’s instant noodles found lead content much beyond the permissible level. The findings cascaded into a chain of events with the product getting banned in several Indian states.

 Narayanan, who was handed over the reins of Nestle India during the turmoil, says it was the faith in his team members that helped them through the crisis.

 “A leader never has all the answers but he has to give hope,” Narayanan said at a business-academia conclave in Mumbai last month. “I laugh when someone says I’m the turnaround MD. I’m not . The turnaround was done by the people in the organisation and I happened to be the guy who was there to lead.”

 Responding to Team Indus founder Rahul Narayan’s query on the one thing he strongly believed in, in the midst of the crisis, Narayanan responded: “Corporate karma.”

 Elaborating on the concept, Narayanan said, “Corporate karma is basically that if a company continues to do good, good will happen to it as well. It’s a belief we have all grown with… This thought really worked for me during the crisis.”

 To another of Narayan’s question on his biggest concern, the business leader said: “My biggest fear was that the arrow had been fired, but I did not know where it was coming from. I hoped and prayed that more arrows didn’t come my way. And some arrows are extremely difficult to navigate. You know… the ones that keep turning around, like those enabled devices that come and get you, come what may, under any circumstances.”"
13,2018-02-26,Nestle,"NEW DELHI: Packaged foods maker Nestle India has kicked off a regional, cluster approach for brands, marketing and activation to fast-track growth and has identified enhanced nutrition as a core focus area, company chairman Suresh Narayanan said here on Monday.

The maker of Maggi instant noodles, KitKat chocolate and Cerelac infant foods, which crossed Rs 10,000 crore in sales for the year ended December 2017, will push increased penetration of products for volume-led growth, which would lead to profitability, he said.

“We are evolving a structure to divide markets into 10-15 clusters, and are segmenting product variants, distribution, sales, marketing and communication in relevant geographies,” Narayanan said. Product segmentation would mean regional variants of existing brands across the portfolio, for example, for ketchup, coffee and confectionery. The India arm of the Swiss company is targeting a minimum 3-5% incremental sales each from the regional variants. 

Narayanan said the company is working on reducing salt and sodium content in Maggi noodles by 10% over the next 12-18 months, in line with evolving consumer preferences. Nestle has reduced sodium and salt content in Maggi noodles by about a third over the past few years, and last year, reduced sugar content in chocolate brand Milkybar and Milo milk drink.

Nestle will accelerate innovation and is looking at a dual strategy of hyper localisation and bringing in new products from its global portfolio including protein supplements, in line with its objective of broadbasing its portfolio as a multi-brand company. Narayanan said of the over 40 new products that were launched last year, about 10-15% needed to be re-tweaked or discontinued, while the rest were successful. He said premium coffee and snacks were potential categories the company is actively exploring venturing into.

Its mainstay brand Maggi contributed 35% of the company’s reported growth in 2017, while 25% growth came from new products.

Narayanan said the company, which follows a January-December ’17 accounting year, is optimistic on the consumption outlook. “The last couple of quarters have been fairly encouraging in terms of urban consumption, along with relatively stable commodity prices. Rural growth could be impacted by monsoons, but we expect mid to high single growth,” he said."
14,2018-02-27,Nestle,"NEW DELHI: Keeping in line with changing consumer preference towards healthier products, Swiss food giant Nestle said it will cut salt content in its instant noodles Maggi by a further 10% in 12-18 months. Over the years, Nestle has reduced salt in Maggi by 33%. The instant noodles brand, which has remained the mainstay of Nestle’s Indian portfolio, contributed around 35% to the company’s growth in 2017.

“This change is happening not only in the packaged food business but also across categories such as cosmetics,” said Arvind Singhal, founder of retail consultancy Technopak. “There is a consumer backlash against products that are perceived to have higher content of sugar, salt and chemicals. There is a definite consumer shift towards products that have natural and Ayurvedic properties.”

And Nestle isn’t the only food company that has been talking about tweaking products — to not only satiate palates of Indian consumers’ but also their newfound bias towards healthier products.

Global food and beverage giants Coke and PepsiCo were some of the first companies to jump on to the health bandwagon. While PepsiCo has chalked out a strategy to shift its business away from colas to premium food products, Coke has pledged to reduce sugar content across its portfolio.

Even junk food companies have been proactive. Recently, multinational fast food chain KFC chose rice bran oil over palm oil to fry its products in India. Similarly, Gunjan Shah, VP of sales at Britannia, said there is increased demand for fortified food. “For instance, we have seen traction for bread that is fortified with vitamins.”"

Norway’s sovereign wealth fund delivered its biggest return on record in 2017, capping a year in which it passed the $1 trillion mark and shocked markets by proposing to drop oil and gas stocks.

Not since the fund was created at the end of the last century has it made more money in a single year, measured in kroner, the Oslo-based investor said on Tuesday. The 2017 return was equivalent to $131 billion, or 13.7 per cent.

The fund’s growing exposure to the stock market means that returns may be more volatile in the future, Chief Executive Officer Yngve Slyngstad said at a press conference in the Norwegian capital.

Owning on average 1.4 per cent of the world’s listed stocks, the fund largely follows indexes but has leeway for some active management. It’s in the process of raising the share of stocks in its portfolio to 70 per cent to improve returns. It’s also increasing its influence in areas such as executive pay, corporate corruption and sustainable investing.

“The fund’s cumulative return since inception has passed 4,000 billion kroner. One out of four kroner of return was generated in 2017, after a very strong year for the fund,” Slyngstad said in the statement.

The 13.7 per cent return was generated in a year characterized by the biggest stock-market boom in eight years. The development pushed stocks closer to a 70 per cent target.

The fund’s stock portfolio rose 19.4 per cent in the year, while fixed income investments gained 3.3 per cent and real estate grew 7.5 per cent. It held 66.6 per cent in stocks at the end of 2017, 30.8 per cent in bonds and 2.6 per cent in real estate.

Its biggest equity investments in 2017 were Apple Inc., Nestle SA and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, while its largest fixed income holdings were U.S., Japanese and German government bonds.

The fund has also moved more into emerging markets over the past years to raise returns and Norway is currently looking into whether it should buy private equity and infrastructure.

The government withdrew 61 billion kroner from the fund last year, after tumbling oil prices forced its first-ever withdrawals in 2016."
0,2018-03-01,Nestle,"Consumer goods MNCs from Nestle and Hindustan Unilever to Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are pushing localisation to the last mile to counter regional competition, fight back the onslaught of local brands, and expand penetration and reach in a market that is showing green shoots of consumption revival.

“There are many Indias in India. Each of them needs to be served differently,” Nestle India chairman Suresh Narayanan said.

The maker of Maggi noodles and Nescafe said it needs to expand beyond the top 100 towns to ensure sustainable growth for the future and is exploring regional variants of existing brands across its portfolio, for example, for ketchup, coffee and confectionery. “Evolving a structure to divide the markets into 10-15 clusters. And, segmenting product variants, distribution, sales, marketing and communication in relevant geographies should ensure better penetration in existing markets and help expand in adjacent markets,” Narayanan said.

For years, home-grown brands have overshadowed global consumer product companies, especially in food segments such as tea, snacks and biscuits, by catering to local tastes and having deeper inroads into the hinterland. MNCs are trying to change this. Nearly three years ago, HUL divided its operations in the country into 14 clusters — under the strategy ‘Winning in Many Indias’ — that helped it raise the quality of distribution and counter local competition. The strategy is handy even for product innovations.

“Our winning in many Indias strategy has helped us understand finer nuances about local consumers,” said Sudhir Sitapati, executive director-refreshments.

HUL launched a lighter version of its coffee brand, Bru Kannadigara, specifically for the Karnataka market earlier this month. “Filter coffee is the preferred coffee in Tamil Nadu while people in Karnataka have a completely different taste profile,” he said.

“Local brands typically have a sense of what the customers want in their area. Another huge differentiator is visibility and availability, which local brands have traditionally been better at ensuring,” said Arun Narayanan, chief growth officer at Bizom, which helps FMCG brands in order and inventory management. “With technology helping solve those problems, the field becomes more level playing, but the brands that understand local tastes will always have an edge.”

A study done by Bizom showed that local brands such as Naturalle in Telangana and Sunpure in Karnataka dominate the oil segment. Balaji overtook Lays in Mumbai and Maiyas is doing better than Haldiram in Bengaluru.



Even in beverages, a slew of regional brands which are sold only in one or two markets and often operate on intensely competitive trade margins and lower consumer prices, have been holding ground against national ones. There are at least 200 such regional aerated drinks including Bovonto from Kali Aerated Water Works in Tamil Nadu, Hajoori & Sons which sells Sosyo, Ginlim and Lemee in Maharashtra and Rajasthan, and Xalta and City Cola in and around Delhi.

Beverages maker Coca-Cola’s president for India and Southwest Asia, T Krishnamukar, said a core focus area for the company was launching region-specific, localised variants of its juices and juice-based drinks under its Minute Maid and Maaza brands. “We want to convert, for example, every mango grown in the country into a beverage. If you have fruits growing only in your area and if you have a beverage based on that, it obviously gives you good consumer connect,” he said. The company, known for aerated drinks Coca-Cola, Thums Up and Sprite, said expansion of its portfolio is based on a “fruit circular economy”, which it says enables farmers to increase yield and companies source pulp locally. Coca-Cola has already seeded select regions with grape-flavoured Portello and jeera drink RimZim.

PepsiCo India VP Harsh K Rai said: “We are focused on developing locally relevant functional nutrition solutions in convenient formats suited to the rushed lifestyles of young, urban Indians.” He said the company’s flagship snacks brand Kurkure has been regionalising and diversifying to cater to changing consumer needs. Local variants under Kurkure include Kurkure Green Chilli Chatka for the North, Hyderabadi Hungama for the South, and Solid Masti for the West. Within beverages, PepsiCo said its core Tropicana range has regional skews such as pomegranate for the North or guava for the South. Other regionalised products from PepsiCo include Quaker Nutri Foods in traditional South Indian cuisine."
1,2018-03-05,Nestle,"MUMBAI: Local candy makers, including Parle, ITC and DS Foods grabbed shares from multinationals in the Rs 7,500-crore confectionery segment, as per latest Nielsen data sourced from industry officials.

Global firms such as Perfetti Van Melle, Mondelez and Nestle either remained stagnant or lost share last calendar year, hurt by higher prices of their wares in a stressed market due to demonetisation. Marketers feel even a 50 paise price hike could impact growth in the price sensitive category.

Over the past three years, Mondelez India relaunched Halls from 50 paise earlier to Rs 1 and doubled its price of Choclairs to Rs 2 while Perfetti Van Melle India launched most of its candies including Alpenliebe at Rs 1 and upwards. Parle Products, however, kept their product prices unchanged. “Post demonetisation, lot of lower denomination currency came back into circulation that had helped sales for a 50 paise product.

But at the same time, the practice of consumers accepting a Rs 1 toffee from grocers stopped to a large extent,” said B Krishna Rao, category head at Parle Products that sells brands including Mango Bite and Poppins. Parle gained 160bps in 2017 with 16% in the confectionery space, while Perfetti lost share marginally by 20bps at 10.2%. Including chewing gums, Perfetti is by far the market leader controlling nearly a quarter of the overall market. As a category, the entire industry has been trying to move to Rs 1 price point after increase in the price of sugar, other raw materials and even packaging costs.




“The focus has been on premiumisation with significant growth achieved for the Rs 1 and above portfolio in the confectionery segment. Growth has been achieved through introduction of differentiated offerings under the Candyman range,” said a spokesperson at ITC that gained 130 bps to reach at 10.2% share. To be sure, India’s leading chocolate makers too posted near decade-low growth in sales last fiscal, as health-conscious consumers cut back on discretionary buying in a slowing economy.

Mondelez, India’s largest chocolate maker, and Nestle’s chocolate divisions saw sales rise by about 6% each in the year to March 2017 — better than a year ago but far from the double-digit growth the candy rivals have seen in most of the last decade. Yet, they remain bullish in the candy segment that has also seen a rush of new players both from large food companies such as DS foods as well as regional local brands.

“As leaders in chocolates and strong challengers in other categories we operate in, we continue to invest and innovate our brands,” said Amit Shah, associate director — marketing (gum, candy & beverages) at Mondelez India, that sell Halls and Cadbury Choclairs. Perfetti too posted below 1% growth for the second consecutive year last fiscal and said competition is getting intense, especially in the candies segment.

“Whilst we had moved much of our portfolio from the 50 paise price point to Rs 1, with product value addition, the bulk of the market stays at 50 paise, leading to strong market challenges,” it said in the annual filing with the Registrar of Companies last year."
2,2018-03-09,Nestle,"ET Intelligence Group : Amid bouts of sustained selling in the equity markets, some good-old multinational blue chip companies with proven business models that have shown signs of a turnaround may once again attract investor interest.

Nestle India, Castrol India and Colgate-Palmolive are among such companies that have reported over 30 per cent earnings growth in the December quarter after years of notso-impressive performance; their management commentary, too, was also positive. Here’s a low-down on these three companies:




NESTLE INDIA
After the Maggi fiasco in 2015 — its biggest profit contributor — Nestle has launched nearly 50 products, and is simultaneously working on cost rationalisation. Fuelled by the new products and recovery in Maggi sales, the company has reported 15 per cent sales growth and 36 per cent EBIDTA (earnings before interest depreciation and tax) growth in the December quarter. Its 18 per cent domestic business growth was the highest in the peer set.

The management has said that the momentum of launches will continue. As part of its strategy, the management has divided India into 15 clusters to target customers better. It will introduce products specific to the needs of each cluster over a period of time. Given Nestle’s healthy track record of innovation and strong distribution reach, it will be the key beneficiary of the expected urban consumption recovery.

The company’s new approach backed by improving numbers reaffirms that it is coming off the slowdown phase. Its stock is currently trading at 40 times the expected FY19 earnings. Historically it has traded at higher multiples.


CASTROL INDIA
Leading automotive and industrial lubricant manufacturing company Castrol’s 16 per cent growth in volumes and 43 per cent jump in EBIDTA indicate full restoration of normalcy after several quarters of weak performance. What’s even better that the growth is likely to continue. The management said that it is seeing a sustained gain in market share in the personal mobility segment and an increase in market share in the commercial vehicle (CV) segment.

Analysts who met the management are positive on the CV segment with revival in freight. Further, margins are on the upswing with operating leverage kicking in — most of the incremental sales trickling down to bottom-line as costs are the same. On expected FY19 earnings, its stock is trading at 25 times, multi-year low multiples and at 3 per cent dividend yield.


COLGATE-PALMOLIVE
Following the strategy of its rival Patanjali, Colgate too has been increasing its share of herbal products in its portfolio with natural offerings such as Cibaca Vedshakti, Swarna Vedshakti, Colgate Active range and Colgate Herbal. Although its overall market share is declining, its share in the herbal offerings is improving which is a positive sign.

While the valuations factor in the declining market share, the good thing is the probability of losing the share from current levels is low. And even if it happens, the pace of share decline will be very slow.

With a series of herbal offerings and increased ad spends, the volume growth is expected to revive. In the December quarter, its sales and EBIDTA grew by 19 per cent and 32 per cent, respectively. Its stock is trading at 38 times FY19 estimated earnings.

This is not cheap, but with growth kicking in, it will be able to sustain high multiples despite general market weakness."
3,2018-03-09,Nestle,"In an interview with ET NOW, Neeraj Deewan, Director, Quantum Securities talks about his top picks in midcap space, outlook for sugar segment and stocks that may do better going ahead in the market. Edited excerpts:

ET Now: What is your general approach towards midcaps given the current market scenario? Is it time to get out of midcap stocks and switch to largecaps as they offer a better margin of safety?
Neeraj Deewan: I would not advise anyone to get out of midcaps rather one has to be selective while investing in midcap and smallcap stocks. Definitely the management quality and the growth have to be taken into consideration before deciding to invest in any stock. Even after the market fall, midcaps have corrected a lot. A lot of them have corrected up to 25-30 per cent.

I will still stick to my investment thesis that at least 30-40 per cent of your portfolio should include midcaps because they are the ones that give you extraordinary returns when the markets turn.

Now is a good time to select midcaps especially the ones which have performed very well even in this downfall. These stocks are the ones that have been stable. One should definitely keep a small part of their portfolio ready to be invested again in midcaps once the tide turns.


ET Now: What is on your shopping list in the midcap space?
Neeraj Deewan: Stocks focussing more into domestic demand have gone up a lot and now they are correcting. Then there are spaces like the automobile ancillary space in which stocks like Jamna Auto were doing well because of the demand coming back to the commercial vehicle segment. So, now is a good opportunity to buy such stocks.

The real estate sector too is undergoing some improvement. Stocks like DLF, Indiabulls Real Estate can be looked at as there are talks about them becoming debt-free in the next six-seven quarters.

So we can look at real estate, commercial vehicle focused auto ancillary space, retail (Future Lifestyle) and textile stocks (Nandan Denim). These stocks have corrected along with the market correction and are domestically focussed. They are likely to gain with the improvement in the market and the results of the past four-five quarters of these companies have been pretty encouraging too.


ET Now: Going forward into the year, do you believe that outperformance would be restricted to some of the largecap names as oppose to midcaps because we know it is going to be a volatile ride this year?
Neeraj Deewan: I will reiterate that some part of your portfolio should have midcap stocks. Whenever the market stabilises, largecaps are the ones that start performing. Midcaps play a catch-up.

In the last two-three years of the bull run that we have seen from FY13 to now, we saw lot of midcaps giving you return of 10-15 times and even after giving those kind of returns on valuation front, these stocks are not that expensive.

For example, if you look at Avanti Feeds over the last four or five years, you will notice that even after rising 20-25 times in share value and the growth the company delivered on profitability front, at the return ratios of 30-35 per cent, the stock does not look very expensive. In the midcap space, you have solid well-managed companies, which have been performing well. One should not put all midcaps in one basket.


ET Now: The one lucrative pocket within midcaps has been the road EPC plays. Do you it is a pocket one could look at? Or do you think valuations and the stock prices have run up too much already?
Neeraj Deewan: The valuation in the prices has run up too fast in some of these companies. Even the prices of the companies that we preferred earlier, like the Sintex Infrastructure, JMC Project, have soared too fast and are not cheap even after the correction.

One has to be very selective while choosing these companies because most of them have healthy order books. We saw this in the last economic upturn too that order books became very healthy but then what happened was that interest rates started going up and execution became a challenge. This may happen again because interest rates in the next two-three quarters may start looking up.

One needs to be careful and select companies which have been there for some time. Companies like HCC and NCC have seen both up and down cycle; they have been in the dumps but are still standing. So such companies will be little better in execution.


ET Now: Are you willing to look at some beaten down banks or would you say that these are best avoided right now? Do private compounding stories like HDFC Bank or HDFC merit a buy on the corrections if and when they come by?
Neeraj Deewan: If you have a long term perspective of two to two-and-a-half years then opportunities in beaten-down PSU Banks may show up. Even the private sector beaten-down banks like ICICI Bank can do well.

With the NCLT resolutions and the exposure these banks are getting their issues might resolve in the next two-three quarters. So, look at this fall as an opportunity to invest in banks with higher corporate exposure. We have seen retail-focussed banks doing well and going ahead they may give you performance returns but I think better returns can come from corporate-facing banks though it will be a choppy ride. But if you invest with a perspective of over two years you will get better returns.


ET Now: Why do you think sugar sector is seeing so much correction?
Neeraj Deewan: Sugar sector has seen two good seasons and it is a cyclical industry. So with markets correcting people are getting scared that sugar’s two-year cycle is coming to an end and it may now see one-and-a–half to two years of bad cycle. This is why some of the selling is in sugar sector is taking place. Sugar prices which were going up earlier have stopped too. One now needs to be careful about this sector because we do not see three-four good cycles for sugar in a row and the sector may now consolidate. However, we have to wait for the coming monsoon to take a call on sugar stocks.


ET Now: What is your outlook on the real estate space? I believe you are fairly upbeat on select names - like DLF and IB Realty, what is the rationale here and why are those your top bets?
Neeraj Deewan: DLF is going through debt repayment and they have are raising money to repay the debt. The price slide has also halted and the stock is becoming more stable now. The interest rates are almost at the bottom and it is the time when demand can really start picking up with economy picking up. That is why DLF would be my pick. And Indiabull Real Estate is also retiring its debt. They plan to list the commercial rental arm and the residential arm separately. This move can create value because they have a good rental income from the commercial space. So once stability comes back in the prices a lot of these capacities will start getting consumed and things will improve on the operational front too.


ET Now: Do you think that the domestic flows into equity markets will continue to sustain?
Neeraj Deewan: Yes, I believe so. A large part of the domestic flows are coming in the form of SIPs and even when our clients ask us, we tell them this is a good time to increase the SIP allocation because you are supposed to invest when the markets are coming down.

Most of the investors must be getting this same advice from all the advisors. If SIP inflows persist the support to the domestic market will continue. Also there are hardly any other options where one can invest money right now. Even the interest rates are quite low on fixed deposits and fixed income securities. So, I think SIP and the support that we are getting from the domestic mutual funds should continue for some time. If the markets take a huge correction or see a long period of correction then you can get concerned about inflows from SIP but immediately there is no such concern.


ET Now: What are your views regarding the FMCG sector and how are you looking at it from a valuation standpoint?
Neeraj Deewan: I am positive on the consumer space and stocks like HUL, Godrej Consumer, Nestle and Britannia. I think ITC has been under pressure. Whereas in the other stocks you see a pick-up in demand and GST is also been of help to them.

When you see valuations I do not see too much value. I am not seeing merit in investing in stocks like Hindustan Lever or Godrej Consumer but there will be pockets like Britannia and Nestle where I think there is still some scope of improvement because there the return ratios are pretty good and they still have some scope of improvement."
5,2018-03-12,Nestle,"NEW DEHI: Many growth stocks in the BSE200 pack today trade at PE multiples as high as 200 times on a trailing basis.

But bond yields in developed markets (DMs) rising and central banks tightening money policies the world over – which are big turnoff for emerging market equities – there are concerns as to whether such growth stocks may sustain at such high multiples.

Higher global bond yields on the back of global economic recovery and higher inflation and normalisation of monetary policies of developed market central banks may result in derating of multiples of the high PE stocks, said Kotak Institutional Equities, which believes the gap between bond and earnings yields is threatening. 

High PE multiple of a growth stock is supported by expectations that the company may continue to deliver above-average industry earnings. 

When bond yields fall, they generally make investments in equities look attractive and lead to re-rating of growth stocks. Due to higher prices that investors wilfully pays to own such stocks, earnings yields (1/PE or E/P) fall.

But when bond yields start rising, the difference between them and earnings yields for growth stocks widen and hurt the latter. To maintain the yield gap, either earnings need to rise or stock prices need to fall. 

Take the example of United Breweries, which trades at a trailing 12-month PE multiple of 116.87. This stock offers earnings yield of 0.85 per cent. Earnings yield is the return that an investor gets on s/her investments. In the case of UB, the yield is very low compared with 10-year bond yield of 7.67 per cent, which is as good as risk-free asset. Stocks such as HDFC Bank from the BFSI sector, Asian Paints, Nestle and Marico from FMCG, Page Industries and Jubilant Foodworks from consumer discretionary and automaker such as Maruti Suzuki are among a few growth stocks that are trading at high PE multiples. The list is long.

“We do not see high P/E stocks in consumer staples and discretionary sectors as defensives in the light of the emerging macro-economic environment. They may hold up better in the short term in the event of a swift market correction, but we find their valuations quite high, as it is not fully factoring in the possibility of higher domestic and global bond yields and/or lower profitability,” said the Kotak report.


Agencies
The report says consumer staples and discretionary sectors have seen big re-ratings of multiples on lower bond yields in the past six to eight years and an expansion of their gross and Ebitda margins due to lower raw material cost in last three to four years.

“Both these positive drivers could reverse in the medium term and it would be interesting to see if (1) their multiples will hold up in case domestic and global bond yields move higher and if their margins hold up if commodity prices were to stay firm. Their ‘moats’ may not be as great as is generally believed in a few cases,” it said.

Jubilant Foodworks (PE of 201 times), Avenue Supermarts (171 times), United Breweries (117 times), Biocon (96.56 times), Hindustan Unilever (78 times) are some of the growth stocks from the BSE200 basket, which trade at high PE multiples. Analysts say investors should look beyond trailing PE multiples. Even a small distruption or a one-off event can make such multiples look so high, even if the underlying fundamentals remain strong.

For example, Jubilant Foodworks’ trailing 12-month EPS has been hurt by its Q4FY17 numbers. During March quarter last year, the company had reported a 76 per cent plunge in net profit. But in the last three quarters, it has reported 25-230 per cent surge in net profit under the new management headed by Pratik Pota.

Nirmal Bang Institutional Research noted that affordability initiatives, strong focus on digital, product quality and overall cost efficiencies has led to superior results for this company in the past two quarters.

This has reinstated confidence in core strategy of the new management. We expect the company to deliver above-industry average earnings growth led by stronger same-store sales growth or SSG, store expansion and improvement in margins, it said. United Breweries numbers too were hit in March quarter last year. 

In an Interview to ET Now CLSA’s Equity Strategist Christopher Wood said: “In a situation where markets are worrying about monetary tightening and higher interest rates in US, the most vulnerable stocks are the growth stocks because they have got the high PE ratios.”

This year, investors should not just own growth stocks, they should also earn more value-orientated stocks because cheaper stocks are much less vulnerable to monetary tightening expectations, Wood told ETNow.


Global case
In a note to clients last month, DBS said overvalued growth stocks had undergone the most severe sell-down in past correction cycles. But this time, the NYSE Fang+ Index, which consists of technology-related growth stocks, had continued to outperform the broader market during the correction phase, suggesting portfolio allocators were holding on to their growth stocks to position for an economic upturn."

Multinational consumer giants like Unilever Plc and Nestle SA typically trade at a discount to their Indian units, given the nation’s growth potential. They’ve become even cheaper after the selloff, prompting Credit Suisse to ask if stock values of their local subsidiaries will follow suit.

“Many large European and U.S. consumer staple stocks have fallen about 15 per cent from their peak last year,” Arnab Mitra, an analyst at the brokerage, wrote in a note on Friday. “Indian consumer stocks that followed global peers on the way up have not seen a correction.”

For instance, Hindustan Unilever Ltd.’s valuation premium over its Anglo-Dutch parent is significantly above the 10-year mean, which wasn’t the case even three months ago, the analyst wrote. Unilever’s one-year forward price-to-earnings ratio has dropped 20 per cent from its peak of 23 times, while its Indian subsidiary is valued at a multiple of 55.

Nestle India Ltd. trades at a trailing price-earnings ratio of 60.3 times, almost twice that of its Switzerland-based parent whose shares have tumbled 9 per cent this year.

The rich valuations are being supported by management commentary about a rebound in rural consumption, Mitra said. This optimism could be cushioning the fall in valuations, for now, he said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s shock cash ban in late 2016 damped farm incomes, while the roll out of the nationwide sales tax in July disrupted supply chains.

“Given the valuation premium, it is critical for companies to at least meet their earnings expectations for Fiscal 2019,” Mitra wrote."

8,2018-03-20,Nestle,"MUMBAI: For top executives of Indian and multinational companies, the posh accommodation that companies used to provide as a perquisite to attract talent is no longer such a compelling proposition.

Many executives who aren’t too keen on this option prefer a big hike in pay packages to compensate. While expats working in India still favour company accommodation, most Indian executives want the flexibility their own house provides.

“The trend of not preferring company-owned accommodation has its origins in the cumulative impact of developments related to tax treatment of such perks, whereby company-owned housing started getting taxed in the hands of the employee at 15% of salary in metropolitan cities (10%/7.5% at other places) irrespective of the fair rental value of the accommodation. Employees would find it more beneficial to get an HRA and claim exemption for rent paid,” said Sonu Iyer, Tax Partner & People Advisory Services Leader, EY India.

Identifying this trend, big corporate houses such as Hindustan Unilever, Citibank, Standard Chartered Bank, Cadbury’s and Nestle have monetised real estate assets located in prime locations of Mumbai, New Delhi, Gurgaon, Bengaluru and Chennai over the last few years.





“We provide an HRA (house rent allowance) component to our employees in the overall salary structure. We have moved away from providing physical housing benefits to the employees,” said a spokesperson of Hindustan Unilever in an emailed response to ET’s query.

HUL has sold several of its residential apartments over the past few years, especially after it shifted its headquarters to Andheri from south Mumbai in 2010. In 2012-13, an exceptional year for the company, it made a profit of Rs 672 crore through sale of real estate. That included its erstwhile headquarters, Lever House, in South Mumbai’s Churchgate, sold for about Rs 300 crore and a guest house and training centre, Gulita, spread over an acre on Mumbai’s Worli seaface, sold for Rs 452 crore.

Immediately after this, the company put more than 55 high-end apartments in prime localities of Mumbai, Kolkata and a land parcel in Hyderabad on the block. Also in 2012, Standard Chartered Bank’s sale of a sea-facing duplex apartment in the Samudra Mahal building at Worli in Mumbai for Rs 40 crore surprised the property market as it fetched Rs 1.10 lakh per sq ft, outpacing an earlier record.

Prior to this, joint owners Standard Chartered Bank and HSBC had sold Bishops Gate, a five-storey residential building in upscale Breach Candy area, for Rs 272 crore. In 2016, HUL sold its south Mumbai guest house 'Alhambra’ on Carmichael Road, which had been home to three former chief executives of HUL—Vindi Banga, Doug Baillie and Nitin Paranjpe—for about Rs 170 crore.

Apart from adapting to employees’ preferences, most companies have been deploying this capital stuck in non-core assets so far back into their core business. “Utilisation of shareholders’ equity for non-core real estate assets is seen as a suboptimal use of capital and is not viewed favourably by shareholders and analysts, and private equity entities in case of unlisted companies. In this context, most companies are monetising such assets and even entering into sale and lease back agreements,” said Anckur Srivasttava, chairman of GenReal Property Advisors that has advised multiple listed companies on such transactions.

While many leading organisations have discontinued the practice of company accommodations, some companies continue to offer this option to executives depending on their preferences. “At Nestlé India, providing our employees with competitive yet flexible benefits is a key proposition of remuneration. Given the changing preferences and lifestyle, we offer our employees to choose either company-leased housing or cash in lieu—this helps them to make choices based on personal needs and preferences,” said a Nestlé India spokesperson.

Mostly, employees prefer flexibility and it suits the companies’ plans too. “Almost no company is carrying large real estate on their balance sheet for providing accommodation to employees. This is non-core for them and the companies are rather giving commensurate hike in the package offered to these executives to offset the impact of housing cost. Employees also prefer that flexibility,” said Atul Vohra, managing partner, Transearch India, an executive search consultant working with Indian business houses and MNCs.

However, there are exceptions such as factory and mines at remote locations as there no good housing options for employees and it would be seen as a crucial support needed for retaining talent. Emergence of new options such as service apartments and cost-effective stays in hotels provided by aggregators has also led to companies’ decision to not carry the burden of these assets.

“With increasing property prices in Mumbai and corporates’ view to lighten their real estate portfolio, there has been a continuous selloff of these guest houses during the past few years. Also, due to the presence of good stay options at five-star hotels and other, more cost-effective choices from many aggregators of hotels and serviced apartments, corporates no longer feel the necessity of owning and maintaining such guest houses,” said Anuj Puri, chairman of ANAROCK Property Consultants. In addition to this, the companies are also continuously looking to exit from non-core assets as these long-held properties have been fetching significant returns for the corporates."

11,2018-03-22,Nestle,"NEW DELHI: The first edition of the Brand Equity Marketing Awards kicked off on Thursday in New Delhi, where our Category Expert Juries evaluated hundreds of entries to pick the best in Integrated Marketing and Social Media.

Arvind Bhandari, senior VP, Nestle said about the judging process: “For me, it was good fun to look at other people’s entries. The advantage was to open my own world and see what others are doing outside of FMCG.” Sanjay Gupta, head of marketing, India and South Asia, Uber, added, “The categories we have here are very relevant and the number of entries are also good.”

Today, juries comprising more of the brightest minds in the business will take on four categories in Mumbai; these are Innovation, Print Marketing, Brand Launch and Digital Marketing.

12,2018-03-23,Nestle,"New Delhi: Packaged food companies in India, including ITC, HUL, PepsiCo and Nestle, may soon have to change their printing and packaging norms due to safety issues with certain chemicals currently being used to print labels and packages.

The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) is working to update the current standard (IS 15495) for printing ink for food packaging and several harmful chemicals, including toluene, may be banned with the new standards coming into effect.

Toluene, a chemical used in paint thinners, has been known to cause liver and kidney damage in humans. It has been banned in the food industry in several countries, while in others such as Sri Lanka, printing associations have voluntarily taken a stand to shun it.

“Around 80% FMCG companies in India still use toluene-based solvents in packaging materials,” said Ashish Pradhan, CEO of the Indian arm of Siegwerk, a German firm that supplies printing ink solutions to companies.

In reply to an email, a Nestle India spokesperson said, “As a responsible corporate citizen, we are always committed to comply with all existing regulations and guidelines. As regards to your query, we ensure that all packaging material coming in direct contact with food is toluene free.” The company plans to stop using toluene altogether by 2018.

An HUL spokesperson said, “At Unilever, we design all our packaging based on product requirements, using global and local guidelines, meeting consumer safety norms.”

However, studies have revealed that toluene can migrate between layers of packaging. ITC and PepsiCo did not reply to emails from TOI.

If the new norms are put in place, printing experts said, FMCG companies have to mandate the usage of toluene-free inks in their technical specifications of packaging material to their packaging suppliers. For instance, Swiss food giant Nestle has done the same in certain markets.

“For the packaging suppliers, there is no requirement for any major/capital investment to run toluenefree inks,” said the industry experts. “The current printing equipment, which runs toluene-based inks, can also run toluene-free inks. It is difficult to estimate the cost implication of this transition as it depends on several factors like type of print job, type of equipment, printing expenditure, apart from ink cost. Having said this, it is important to keep in mind that the ink costs are a fraction of the total packaging cost of any product.”"
13,2018-03-24,Nestle,"NEW DELHI: Is your MBA at a second-rung business school worth it? Barring the top 50 Bschools, the remaining institutes find it difficult to place all their students. As many as half the students in some second and third-rung institutes don’t get placed, according to education experts.

Salary offers have not changed much over the past few years and some experts say the compensation offered can be as low as Rs 2-3 lakh per year. Average salaries at secondrung schools such as the TA Pai Management Institute (TAPMI), Institute of Finance and International Management (IFIM), SRM Institute of Science and Technology (SRMIST) and Jagan Institute of Management Studies (JIMS) have been almost static in the past two years. SRMIST has placed 63% of its batch so far compared with 66% at the same time a year ago. The average annual pay here for both years is Rs 4 lakh. 

Companies like Religare and OrangeScape Technology have offered salaries of Rs 2-3 lakh at SRMIST. At JIMS, salaries at the lower end have been at about Rs 4 lakh for the last three years, with 2015 recording a high of Rs 4.71lakh compared with Rs 4.6 lakh this year. At IFIM, the average salary has not budged from Rs 7.2 lakh last year. The average salary at TAPMI is Rs 10.6 lakh, among the highest in second-rung institutes, compared with Rs 10.1lakh per annum last year. “When compared to last year, the job market for second-tier Bschools is not so promising in terms of hiring,” said VM Ponniah, dean, School of Management at SRMIST. By comparison, a student from one of the top B-schools can expect an annual package of Rs 17-18 lakh on average. 
(Post-publication, TAPMI responded to the story claiming they were not a second-rung B school.)


Patience Key to Finding The Right Fit
“Besides the top 50 institutes where almost all the students get placed, the remaining institutes struggle to place their students with almost 20-50% of students without an offer in hand,” said Bakul Dholakia, former director of the Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Ahmedabad. He attributes this to the quality of faculty, infrastructure and student intake. According to another former faculty member who taught at IIMs, students have to accept offers of Rs 2-3 lakh. “Desperation forces them to take up temporary jobs of running odd errands in companies,” he said.



The fee for a two-year MBA programme at many of the second-tier institutes can go up to Rs 16 lakh while only a handful (less than 5%) get offers that exceed Rs 8 lakh per year.

Business schools such as We-School, Manav Rachna University, Fore School of Management, Jaipuria Institute of Management didn’t respond to queries.

Recruiters typically restrict themselves to the leaders among the tier-2 B-schools. “Campus talent from tier-2 schools is value for money. But we have to be patient in identifying the right fit,” said an HR head at a company that’s a regular visitor to the schools. Deloitte prefers to take the summer internship route, especially when it comes to zeroing in on talent from tier-2 schools. “It is better to go to these institutes and hire the talent through the summer internship.

This gives us a longer time to judge the right fit,” said SV Nathan, chief talent officer at Deloitte India. Currently, it hires only 20% of management personnel from second-rung management schools.

Amazon, another top recruiter at the management schools in India, does not differentiate between talent from top B-schools and the rest.

“The effort is on finding the right talent that would fit the Amazon culture irrespective of the institute,” said an Amazon India spokesperson. “When it comes to hiring new talent, our philosophy is focused on the potential we see in students. With India becoming a major growth story for us, we want top talent from B-schools to build a career at Amazon.”

JIMS in New Delhi said its placement rate is 90% this year. “Whilst recruitments in ecommerce and IT companies may have come down slightly, however, FMCG, consulting, banking and finance companies have etched a large footprint,” said Satish Seth, director general, JIMS New Delhi. Some of the recruiters at the institute include Deloitte, ITC, Asian Paints, Nestle India, ICICI Bank."
14,2018-03-26,Nestle,"NEW DELHI: Top Indian advertisers, which advertise heavily on Facebook, have sought clarifications from the social media giant and expressed their concerns over the Cambridge Analytica data breach controversy that it’s become embroiled in. 

“We have asked Facebook to clarify on what more it will do to ensure consumer protection and the safeguarding of data associated with brands and advertising,” said a spokesperson for Nestle India, the local arm of the world’s largest packaged foods company. “Recent revelations regarding the potential misuse of consumer data by online platforms is something we take very seriously.” 

Nestle used Facebook extensively to chart the comeback of its biggest brand, Maggi noodles, after a ban three years ago. For instance, it posted videos with the hashtag WeMissYouToo on the official Meri Maggi Facebook page. 

The company was “encouraged by the public announcements by Facebook around strengthening data protection,” the Nestle spokesperson said. But “we are concerned by this issue as our business, both online and offline, relies on a strong foundation of trust with our consumers”. 

Digitial advertising is gaining ground amid greater smartphone use and faster 4G connections. A report by Dentsu Aegis Network released in January this year forecast that the Rs 8,200 crore Indian digital advertising industry will grow by a compounded annual growth rate of 32% to Rs 18,986 crore by 2020, with fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) and ecommerce being the two single largest spenders on advertising. Two people who track the industry closely estimated the Indian advertising expenditure on Facebook at Rs 1,700-1,800 crore. 

India overtook the US in Facebook membership last July, crossing the 240-million active user mark, making it one of the most critical markets for the company. 




ITC, another top 10 advertiser, also expressed a broader concern over the spread of fake news through the platform, echoing sentiments earlier expressed by global consumer goods giant Unilever. 

“Certain concerns including ever increasing fake profiles and proliferation of fake news through Facebook need to be addressed on an urgent basis,” said Hemant Malik, ITC divisional chief executive, foods. “Facebook is a large media platform. They have recently changed the algorithm which makes Facebook similar to any other media channel as opposed to being a social media channel, where brands would look for engagement or conversation with users.” 

PepsiCo is another large advertiser that has been steadily increasing its media spending on social platforms to resonate with its core consumers — millennials. “Responsiveness and authenticity will be the key parameters that brands will be evaluated on by consumers on social media,” said PepsiCo India senior vice president, beverages, Vipul Prakash. 

PepsiCo’s core brands — Pepsi cola, Mountain Dew and Nimbooz — are all targeted at young consumers. “The social media landscape in India is one of the largest and continuously evolving,” Prakash said. “With multiple platforms, all stakeholders across social media platforms, advertisers and media agencies will need to work together to ensure that communications by brands to consumers appears in a relevant context.” Facebook India said clients are happy with the steps that the company is taking to safeguard user data. 


Allaying Concerns“Advertisers look to us to help grow their businesses,” spokesperson for Facebook India said. “They know how important it is for people to trust their information with Facebook. Most of the businesses we’ve spoken with this week are pleased with the steps we’ve outlined to better protect people’s data, and they have confidence that we’ll respond to these challenges and become a better partner and company as a result.” The social media company will work with customers to assuage their concerns.

“We’ve seen a handful of reports of clients pausing while they’re assessing these steps we’ve outlined yesterday,” the Facebook spokesperson said. 

“We’re going to work closely with them — and with all of our clients.” Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg belatedly apologised last week for not being able to prevent political advertising firm Cambridge Analytica from getting access to the personal data of 50 million users without their knowledge. He said security would be increased and apps vetted more rigourously to prevent meddling in elections this year in India, the US and elsewhere. 

Biscuit giant Parle Products said it took user data security seriously. “Data breach across any social media is a big cause of concern for us,” said Krishna Rao, category head at biscuit giant Parle Products. “When we do target-based advertising, we are under the opinion that consumer data is private. We would want to restrain from advertising on any social media platform that puts data at risk.” 

Anusha Shetty, chief executive of Autumn Worldwide, a social media agency, said: “Security is the biggest challenge the industry faces and as creators and enablers in this domain, we must all play an active role to ensure we protect and secure consumers on the internet.”

 Last month, the country’s biggest advertiser, Hindustan Unilever (HUL) said it would reduce its spending on online and social media platforms such as Google and Facebook if they didn’t filter out content that was divisive or promoted gender stereotypes and hatred, in line with Dutch parent Unilever’s new global policy. An email seeking comment on the matter from ecommerce giant Amazon, which spends a significant amount on social media, remained unanswered. 

According to the Denstu Aegis Network report, growth in the digital landscape is being fuelled by the rollout of 4G, falling data costs and higher smartphone penetration. The report added that expenditure on digital platforms, which contribute 15% of the overall advertising pie, will reach 24% of the entire market by 2020. Within the digital space, social media contributes the majority 28%."

1,2018-04-03,Nestle,"NEW DELHI: 'Expensive' growth stocks continue to top performance charts on Dalal Street, as despite the recent selloff in the market, concerns over stretched valuations continue to dog investors.

A majority of 35 BSE500-listed companies that hit record highs in last one month are ruling at trailing PE multiples of anywhere between 40 and 230, which suggests investors still prefer growth to value.

Among these stocks, Domino's Pizza operator Jubilant Foodsworks hit an all-time high of Rs 2,396 on March 27, trading at 230 times its trailing 12-month earnings per share.

Radhakishan Damani's Avenue Supermarts hit its record high exactly a month ago to rule at 177.7 times trailing price multiples. 

Kishore Biyani's Future Lifestyle and Tata Group's Titan Company are a few other examples of growth stocks that have hit all-time highs in last one month.

In the broader market, six of every 10 BSE500 stocks traded at least 20 per cent below their all-time high levels.

""In last one quarter or two, the market has been in mood to reward companies with certainty of earnings. It is not looking at companies where earnings could be iffy or where there is speculation about whether the numbers will be good. We certainly think rural consumption is going good. Urban consumption is also reasonably holding up, even though valuations are not cheap. We expect 15-20 per cent earnings growth,"" Rajat Jain, CIO, Principal PNB AMC, told ETNow on Tuesday.

Jain does not agree with the growth-only approach, through he agrees this is where the market is tilted.

Jubilant Foodworks has reported strong same-store sales growth, led by high volumes and 6-7 per cent price hikes after GST rollout. The company has seen strong consumer response to its new offer (Everyday Value) and pizza upgrade, HDFC Securities said in a note.

Edelweiss Securities expects Avenue Supermarts to report revenue, Ebitda and PAT growth of 25.5 per cent, 31.8 per cent and 41.2 per cent, respectively, over FY17-20.

Titan joined the elite Nifty50 club on Tuesday.

""High quality stocks will keep making new highs. But stocks which are making lifetime highs, let’s say D-Mart or Jubilant Life or Titan, are extremely expensive companies. They are trading in multiples of 70-80 and yet they are making new highs,” said Amit Jeswani, CIO at Stallion Asset.

""It is clearly showing that the trend is towards high quality stocks and 2018 will be about chasing quality, and not low-quality stocks,"" Jeswani said. 

Data showed stocks like Nestle India, Astral Poly, Bajaj Electrical, Bharat Forge, V-Mart Retail, Thomas Cook

Endurance Tech, Phoenix Mills and Lakshmi Mach Works, among others, have hit record highs this month.

 None of these stocks have PE values lower than 40. Equity benchmark BSE Sensex currently trades at 22.93 times its 12-month EPS. 
""Low-quality stocks are now a part of everyone’s portfolio. These stocks are not going to rally. It is going to be a move towards high growth, high return on equity, free cash flow and very high quality stocks,” Jeswani told ET Now. 

High PE multiple of a growth stock is supported by expectations that a company may continue to deliver above-average earnings. When bond yields fall, it generally makes equity investment look attractive and leads to re-rating of growth stocks. 

Experts note that growth stocks are not immune to market corrections. 

Kotak Securities said were the macro factors to worsen, growth stocks may also correct. “Their high valuations are unlikely to sustain in a scenario of higher domestic and global bond yields and increased earnings (weaker economic growth), macro and political uncertainty,” it said."
0,2018-04-03,Nestle,"Chief of Army Staff General Bipin Rawat sought the help of consumer goods companies such as Hindustan Unilever, Procter & Gamble, Nestle and Diageo to help stamp out corruption at the Canteen Stores Department (CSD), the single largest customer of consumer goods companies in the country.

“Over the years, there has been some problem with the functioning of our canteen services. Our officers in uniform, at times, indulged in some malpractices and some friends in business partners have supported them,” Rawat told top company executives at a vendor meet in Mumbai on Monday.

“We would want support from business partners to ensure that anybody in uniform who was indulging in malpractices in whatever manner is brought to book.”

CSD, also referred to as the Army Canteen, said it posted sales of Rs 18,000 crore in FY18 through its outlets. It accounts for 5-7% of India’s consumer goods market.

A parliamentary panel had come down heavily on the Army in 2011 for not allowing the audit of unit-run canteens (URCs) while taking note of malpractices in ration supplies for the troops. CSD sought to clean up its act in 2012 by getting rid of the middlemen who were allegedly charging commissions from the companies for getting their goods on to the shelves at the canteen outlets, according to industry executives.

Rawat said CSD has been told to implement a foolproof system and called on the companies to cooperate in this endeavour.




“While we are trying to operate in a transparent mechanism, (we need) your support in this venture of ours,” Rawat said at the meeting in Mumbai.

“We assure you that we will take anyone to task no matter if it’s in the highest headquarters, in the regional centers or in the depots. Any kind of malpractice will not be allowed to flourish in the defence services,” Rawat said.

Putting the CSD’s entire retail system online and automating it would help detect any wrongdoing, said M Baladitya, chairman of the board of administration at CSD.

“Automation is on top of my agenda as that is the answer to all the problems that we face, be it inventory, or visibility and transparency of orders,” Baladitya said at the same event. “If some wrong decisions are taken, it will leave behind an audit trail. Today there is such a big fog that we don't know what is happening and people are misusing their powers.”

He said CSD sales weren’t affected by the rollout of the goods and services tax (GST) on July 1last year.

Several companies had said that CSD destocking ahead of this had affected their earnings.

“Our sales last fiscal was almost untouched by GST,” Baladitya said.

“There was a disruption for two months but that was more than overcompensated after Diwali.”

CSD’s operating margin is 1%, which Baladitya said was the lowest for any retailer in the world, adding that it booked an additional.`1,100 crore in profit in FY18 through long-delayed value added tax (VAT) refunds from several state governments and penalties from companies that breached fair-pricing agreements. This included extending CSD matching promotional offers given to other retailers.

Baladitya has been seeking partnerships in terms of logistics, data analytics and stocktaking, even from other retail organisations, he said.

CSD outlets sell products ranging from biscuits and beer to shampoos and cars to 12 million consumers--personnel of the army, navy and air force, ex-servicemen and their families.

From branded underwear to passenger cars, consumer goods are India’s best stock market bets. And they’re ones you can make money in even when the shares aren’t cheap.

That’s the view of Axis Mutual Fund in Mumbai, whose long-term equity portfolio holds 26 per cent in consumer discretionary and staples companies, together the second largest holding after financials. The fund posted average annual returns of 24 per cent over five years, beating 96 per cent of peers.

“If you want to play India, you need to invest in stories that are directly linked to consumer spending in some form,” Jinesh Gopani, who as head of equities at Axis Asset Management Co. helps oversees about $5.1 billion, said in a recent interview. “In that parlance, even retail-focused banks and select non-bank finance companies are a part of the consumer sector for us.”

A gauge of 255 consumer discretionary companies compiled by S&P BSE gained 54 per cent last year on optimism of a revival in demand after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s cash prohibitions in late 2016 and the the roll out of a nationwide sales tax in July. Government aid for farmers and expectations of normal rainfall have raised expectations of a pick-up in sales in the hinterland, pushing up valuations of these companies.

Avenue Supermarts Ltd., operating DMart chain of supermarkets, now trades at a 12-month blended forwards price-to-earning of 80.5, higher than even its own average of 70, as per data compiled by Bloomberg. Similarly, India units of multinational companies like Unilever Plc and Nestle SA have held on to their high valuations even when the parent companies have seen a correction.

“Valuation depends on what is your long term horizon,” Gopani said. “If you feel India is going to grow at 7 per cent to 7.5 per cent for the next 10 years, consumer companies at the bare minimum can grow at 1.5 times of that GDP growth or maybe more”

Axis Long Term Equity Fund, run by Gopani, has car maker Maruti Suzuki India Ltd., Pidilite Industries Ltd. and Avenue Supermarts Ltd. among its top 10 holdings, five of which are private sector lenders.

“We believe 60-70 per cent of the good news is priced in the prices. Going forward, if the real recovery happens, an earnings upgrade is possible in FY20,” he said."
3,2018-04-06,Nestle,"NEW DELHI: Stocks such as Apollo Tyres, Avenue Supermarts, InterGlobe Aviation (IndiGo) and Nestle India have gone on to hit their fresh 52-week highs on BSE on Friday even as equity markets remained lacklustre, mainly because of profit-booking.

Stocks such as Birla Cable, Bharat Parenterals, H.G. Infra Engineering, Indiabulls Ventures, Jubilant Foodworks, LKP Finance, Mphasis, Orient Press, Pidilite Industries and SRF too joined the bandwagon of stocks that defied bearish market stance to hit 52-week highs.

Domestic equity benchmarks were appearing dull after Thursday's rally with benchmark Sensex rising 577 points after the RBI kept the policy rate unchanged but said growth will rebound this fiscal amid softening inflation.

Selling by participants, mostly of a profit-booking nature, attributed the fall in select counters. Major European markets too were reflecting bearish temperament.

The NSE Nifty index was trading 8 points down at 10,317, while the BSE Sensex was down 6 points at 33,591 around 01:25 pm (IST).

Among the 31 stocks in the Sensex kitty, 13 were advancing, while 18 were declining in trade.

4,2018-04-06,Nestle,"NEW DELHI: The domestic equity market in a choppy trade on Friday ended near the flat line, as investors chose to remain on the sidelines, after US President Donald Trump signalled additional tariffs worth $100 billion on Chinese goods.

Gains in index heavyweights ICICI Bank, Tata Steel and Maruti Suzuki were offset by losses in Bharti Airtel, Infosys and Larsen & Toubro.

Profit booking amid subdued global cues too hit market mood.

In Trump's latest salvo, he said late on Thursday that he had instructed US trade officials to consider $100 billion in additional tariffs on China. Beijing warned it would fight back ""at any cost"" with fresh measures to safeguard its interests, Reuters reported.

Consequently, Nifty closed flat at 10,332, while the Sensex settled with a slight gain of 30 points, or 0.09 per cent, at 33,627.

Among the 50 stocks in the Nifty pack, 25 stocks advanced, while 25 declined. On the other hand, out of total 31 stocks in the Sensex team, 16 ended in the green, while 15 in the red on Friday.

However, for the week, Nifty managed to clock a gain of over 2 per cent. Sensex, on the other hand, rose almost 2 per cent for the week.

Broader BSE Midcap and smallcap indices climbed up to 0.65 per cent on Friday.

Maruti, Adani Ports and HDFC Bank too figured among the gainers on Sensex. On the contrary, Bajaj Auto, IndusInd Bank and Axis Bank lost steam.

“Market was rangebound, as investors are still nervous about global trade tensions, while better domestic triggers, are providing support. Focus has shifted to earnings, which are at an early stage of revival. Any scope of upgrade will subside volatility due to global headwinds. PSU banks and pharma stocks outperformed due to gradual accumulation and USFDA approvals,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.

Among the sectors on BSE, telecom remained the top losers, declining over 1 per cent. IT, capital goods, metal and teck also closed in the red. 

Pharma stocks, however, caught investors' attention on Friday, with Aurobindo Pharma and Lupin gaining over 3 per cent.

Apollo Tyres, Avenue Supermarts, InterGlobe Aviation (IndiGo), Nestle India, Jubilant Foodworks, Pidilite Industries and SRF bucked the market trend to hit fresh 52-week highs on BSE.

10,2018-04-17,Nestle,"NEW DELHI: Nestle India today scaled a lifetime high on the BSE after foreign brokerages Goldman Sachs and CLSA raised its target price. 

Global investment bank Goldman Sachs has upped the company's 2018-20 EPS (earnings per share) estimate by 3-5 per cent. It has raised the target price to Rs 7,354, from Rs 6,786 earlier, and maintained 'neutral' rating on the stock, which hit a record high of Rs 8,950. 

As per the GS estimate, Nestle India's average domestic sales would grow at 15 per cent over 2018-20, driven by demand for new products like Greek yogurts and brand extensions under the Milkmaid brand.

Nestle’s overall volumes, a report by Kotak Securities said, grew 11 per cent yoy in 2017 as Maggi turnaround story continued and other segments returned to positive volume growth territory. This was the first time since 2010 that volumes grew across segments even as the figures remained below the 2011 levels.



The company's stock soared 91.35 per cent in the past 5 years while it surged 41.06 per cent in the last 12 months. 

The consumer firm has not completely reversed the volume damage caused by its excessive margin focus during 2010-16 and the Maggi crisis, the report stated. 

""Even as absolute volumes for each of the four business segments -- milk products and nutrition, beverages, prepared dishes and cooking aids and chocolate and confectionery -- still remain below 2011 levels, we see the 2017 volume print as an encouraging sign of revival led by early success of the new management’s interventions,"" the brokerage said in its report.

Nestle reported net revenue growth of 9.7 per cent yoy for 2017, with domestic space growing 10.3 per cent and export accounting for 0.9 per cent. The company estimates an adjusted comparable revenue growth of 11.8 per cent, according to the annual report. 

Ebitda growth of 10.1 per cent yoy came in line with revenue growth as the company pursued a volume-centric strategy that led to gross margin erosion in the first half of 2017.

PAT grew by 21.1 per cent at a faster pace than operating profit growth on the back of lower provision for contingencies and lower effective tax rates (ETR) at 33.4 per cent versus 35 per cent in 2016. 

Brokerage firm CLSA said strong growth in earnings along with reduction in working capital drove free cash flow growth of 20 per cent yoy in 2017. It has raised the target price to Rs 9,750 from Rs 8,950, but downgraded the stock to 'outperform' from 'buy', citing a 13 per cent surge in the past one month. 

Nestle trades at 54x one-year forward PE, which CLSA said should sustain in the context of 19 per cent EPS compound annual growth rate (CAGR). CAGR is measure of how much a person’s investment grew in one year. In other words, it is average returns an investor has earned on the investments after one year. 

Of 32 analysts covering the stock, 22 have a buy or higher rating, 6 hold, while 4 sell or lower ratings with a median target price of Rs 8,650, showed Reuters data.

The stock has risen over 27 per cent in nearly 10 weeks up to Monday after it hit a multi-month low on February 8. The Nifty FMCG index advanced 2 per cent during the same period."

13,2018-04-26,Nestle,"Earnings at Colgate, Hindustan Unilever, Maruti Suzuki or Nestle, the bluest of the MNC blue-chips listed in India, could expand between 6 per cent and 15 per cent after the local market regulator made it harder for the units to make high royalty payments to their global parent companies.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) accepted in part the Kotak Committee recommendation, which had initially suggested that the locally listed companies seek approval of minority shareholders in India for royalty payments beyond 5 per cent of revenue. Now, however, the local units of global MNCs need the approval from the “majority of minority” shareholders if they have to make royalty payments beyond 2 per cent of consolidated revenue.



The Street estimates that Indian units of global companies – Colgate, Gillette, GSK Consumer, HUL, Maruti, Nestle, or P&G – have royalty expenses in the range of 0.7-5.5 per cent of net sales. If rates fell to 2 per cent after the SEBI move, the projected earnings of consumer companies Colgate, GSK, HUL, and Nestle could see an upside of 6-15 per cent, according to Credit Suisse.

The biggest beneficiary would be Colgate and Nestle. CLSA said in a note that “…in case there is any change with the existing royalty structure,… every 1 per cent change in royalty has 4-5 per cent impact on earnings for HUL, Nestle, Colgate and GSK”. However, the extent of earnings growth for the local units will depend on how strictly the rules are enforced, leaving little room to reclassify royalty.

Royalty rates have risen significantly in the past few years. For instance, HUL spent 3.3 per cent of sales in royalty in FY17, up from just more than 1 per cent in FY11. Maruti Suzuki has indicated that royalty payment as a percentage of sales may fall with increasing sales volumes of cars with higher Indian R&D inputs. Royalty payment of Maruti in the third quarter of FY18 stood at 5.3 per cent of sales.

To be sure, the Street is seeking clarity on a number of issues. First, whether all existing agreements of Indian units making more than 2 per cent in royalty payments need approvals, or would the modifications in royalty payment apply to new pacts. Second, there is scope for clarity on the treatment of brand royalty and technology fees."
2,2018-05-02,Nestle,"In an interview, Safir Anand, Investor & Strategist, says some consumption play is left in migration to GST side while he finds potential in midcap IT stocks. However, he has solid respect for the tyre industry. Edited excerpts: 

How would you look at playing the consumption theme? Right now it is the most fancied theme. But valuations seem stretched for the entire segment. How do you pick and choose? How do you buy and hold?
I will start with a caveat that some of the consumption ideas that I hold today are ideas that I bought when GST was introduced and to that extent, have benefited from the price movement that is already reflected in the stock prices. 

Having said that, GST is still migrating and when I read interviews coming from top level consumption companies -- whether it is Nestle or Britannia, I am more interested in seeing the size of the market that lies before them. 

There are two sides of this. One, the general size of the market is growing because of more and more people are finding the consumption sector acceptable. It is more like a volume denominated growth and because these companies are efficient in terms of their annual reports, volume denominated growth obviously translates into better cashflows and higher margins because the companies deploy capital at a far better rate than most other companies. 

The second side is a little bit on the migration side where there are value-added products being introduced by these companies. The Maggi was a clear example recently. The value-added products create new market segments and give higher incremental power to earnings.

Since GST itself is relatively new and we still have people who are grappling with compliances and forms and other things, the story of migration will continue for a while. Until and unless, the efficiencies set in all respects, the unorganised sector has lost a certain part of the market share. Then one will have to take a call on whether they would like to own stocks in this sector or move on to other promising plays.


IT as a theme has been the darling of the markets in the last six months. Do you believe that it is actually niche mid-cap IT where you find value? What do you like in mid-cap IT interests you?
The large companies have become dependent upon very large order inflows which in turn come from clients that have substantial bargaining power. When you are on the receiving end of bargaining power, you do not want to lose the prestigious client and therefore you end up with lesser hourly rates or lesser project costs. 

But when it comes to niche companies, they are developing new segments, they could be centric around retail, they could be centric around aviation, tourism and other forms. And some of these companies had decent cashflows but were completely surrounded by the negative taboo around the IT stock valuation and US visa issues and global concerns.

What their annual reports and management commentaries are suggesting is that they were scaling up the R&D expense to a certain extent and were bettering their financials but the market was not willing to value them over a 10 PE or a 9 PE while they were moving up the value chain. Some of these IT niche stories actually got rerated in the last one year and continue to report in robust numbers that seem to suggest that the thought process of disruption in new segments is more attuned to them than a larger player who may be doing substantial part of his business as routine and not really into too much of artificial intelligence and other things of that kind.


You talk about intellectual properties and cash flows but what about valuations because the stocks which you currently like essentially are some of these IP companies, brand owners but they are also trading at levels which I have not heard of! Titan at PE of 70, Venky’s I do not even want to calculate the PE multiple thereof. Unilever is trading at a historic high. It has never traded at these levels even in the last bull market.
Well that is true. A large part of that answer comes in from assessing whether the moats being created by the companies are going to last or assessing that the moats are being threatened by what is called a disruptive innovation. In some cases, there is disruptive innovation which is not necessarily emanating from the companies itself. 

For example, in consumer companies a lot of disruption is coming in from a transition into a GST model and a migration from the unorganised sector to the organised sector. 

Just to give you an example, you know how Gillette’s entire business was threatened by Dollar Shave Club which reached unprecedented valuations before it was acquired by Unilever globally. Today they have a sizable part of the market and Gillette is to some extent struggling with loss of market share. It is essentially seeing if the potential of these companies is commensurate to the market size.


I noticed that you also like tyre companies. It is centred around IP. You like brand companies, you like to buy companies which have a moat around them. With this kind of an approach, why are you betting on tyre companies because tyre business is not a high margin business?
Right. My bet on the tyre sector started when MRF was at a market cap of about 2400 crore. MRF’s current market cap should be in excess of Rs 35,000 crore. 

Ceat’s market cap was about close to Rs 500 crore and Ceat must have gone up may be about 10-12-14 times. The essential point was that the tyre segment at that point of time was being completely ignored by the market for it is a commodity play and is dependent upon rubber prices. 

There are threats from China and retreading is a threatening business etc. But you know there was a complete transformation on the technology side of tyres with greater focus being spent on creating businesses that were more safety aligned as opposed to just a commodity. 

If you see the transition of the advertisements that were being released by the tyre companies for the last two or three years, the essential mindset is of human safety. 

The second thought was that when a company like MRF was at a market cap of Rs 2500-crore odd, they had announced a capex in excess of Rs 6000 crore plus. If one looks into the history of a company like MRF, there is no doubt that it is a very strong brand and therefore not really a commodity. 

If we think tyre companies are commodities, then typically they should not be subject to antidumping duties or competitive pressures like Competition Commission etc because those typically apply to businesses that are cartels or businesses that have a monopoly and not really commodities in the typical sense.

Be as it may, if you looked into the balance sheet, the entire company has been built around share capital of about Rs 2 crore. So, if you think that a two-crore company with a kind of capex can take on a Rs 6000-crore expansion and in between, set up an MRF Cricket Academy go and do large deal sponsorship, the cost of one sponsorship that they do of a cricket bat would be more than the entire equity capital -- then you have to understand the transition is happening in those businesses. 

And the tyre segment in India was seeing the entry of larger players from overseas the likes of Bridgestone and Michelin etc and had not really seen any acquisition except that companies like JK Tyres were making acquisitions and the turnaround was quite favourable. So, it was a mindset of the consumer, it was an effective allocation of capital that was improving. 

The threat from China anyways was not real, that threat was more centric around the business of trucks and heavy auto vehicles and not really on the passenger car segment or the two-wheeler segments and therefore it amounted to a reasonable bet at that point of time which is continuing right now also because of the benefits of rubber prices."

The S&P BSE Sensex ended 0.15 per cent lower for the week at 34,915, while the NSE Nifty settled at 10,618, down 0.69 per cent.

Here's a list of seven developments that may move the market in the coming week:


Next batch of earningsAmong notable names, ICICI Bank, Tata Chemicals and Tata Coffee are slated to announce January-March results on Monday, while ABB India and Jubilant FoodWorks will unveil their score cards on Tuesday. Eicher Motors and JSPL are scheduled to announce results on Wednesday.

Adani Enterprises, Asian Paints, Nestle India, Tata Communications, Titan Company, Union Bank of India and Zee Entertainment Enterprises will release their quarterly numbers on Thursday. Gillette India and Tata Global Beverages will announce January-March numbers on Friday.


Karnataka pollsThe Karnataka Legislative Assembly elections 2018 is scheduled to be held across the state on May 12. Results of the poll will be out on May 15. Leading parties, the ruling Congress and the BJP, have been campaigning aggressively in the state for the last few months to woo voters. Chief Minister Siddaramaiah will be fighting against BJP's BS Yeddyurappa for the CM's post in the upcoming polls. Market will keenly follow the developments from the state.


US jobs dataUS job growth increased less-than-expected in April and the unemployment rate dropped to near a 17.5-year low of 3.9 per cent, as some out-of-work Americans left the labour force, Reuters reported.

The report also showed wages barely rose last month, which may ease concerns that inflation pressures are rapidly building up, likely keeping the Federal Reserve on a gradual path of monetary policy tightening. Financial markets across the globe, including India may react to it when trading resumes on Monday.


All eyes on US sanctions against IranOil prices rose about 2 per cent on Friday, with US crude hitting its highest in more than three years, as global supplies remained tight and the market awaited news from Washington on possible new sanctions against Iran, Reuters reported. On May 12, the US President Donald Trump will decide whether to extend waivers on economic sanctions against Iran. If it doesn’t, the global market could lose about one million barrels of oil a day, says a Market Watch report.

The sanctions on Iran were lifted under a 2015 agreement among a group of world powers, including the US and Iran, aimed at curbing Tehran’s nuclear activities.


Tech ViewThe Nifty50 index on Friday formed a ‘Dark Cloud Cover’ pattern on daily chart, suggesting possible downside ahead. The pattern may have negative repercussions, which will be confirmed if the Nifty50 closes below the 10,600 level, said Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in.

However, Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, Senior Technical Analyst, Sharekhan has a bullish outlook on the index for the short term with a target 10,910 and reversal placed at 10,500. ""The short term trend will remain bullish as long as it does not close below 10,500. On the way up, 10,708 – 10,785 will be crucial resistance in the near term. The rise in the benchmark index can stretch towards 10,910, if it breaks the crucial resistance level of 10,785,"" Ratnaparkhi said.


Macro numbersThe government will release industrial production data for March on Friday. India's industrial output grew 7.1 per cent in February from a year earlier. This apart, the government will also unveil inflation data based on consumer price index (CPI) for April. Retail inflation stood at 4.28 per cent in March, slowing for the third straight month from a 17-month high, according to data released by the Central Statistics Office.


Global cuesThe big central banking event of next week is the Bank of England’s May 10 meeting, with market expectations overwhelmingly in favour of interest rates being held at the current 0.5 per cent. Interest rate bets have swung around sharply from early April when investors priced a 90 per cent chance of the BoE raising rates by 25 basis points, Reuters reported.

In addition, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) monetary policy meeting minutes will be unveiled on Monday, 7 May 2018."
5,2018-05-08,Nestle,"MUMBAI: Last year, the Times Group launched a one-of-a-kind competition called ‘Power of Print’ in partnership with Nestle. The contest invites participants to work on a live brief and create a print ad. The theme for the contest this year is “Help Parents Know Good Food.”

The objective is to encourage parents in urban India to learn the nutritional truths about Good Food, says a Nestle spokesperson, who added, “We are committed to a campaign that drives behaviour change at scale so that parents can be good food role models for their kids.” Last year, a creative team from JWT India won the competition to create an ad encouraging education of the girl child.

4,2018-05-08,Nestle,"Nestle India is in the process of depositing a transition amount in the consumer welfare fund for not immediately passing on benefits under the goods and services tax (GST), the latest in a line of companies including Hindustan Unilever that has offered to make such payments. Nestle didn’t give details of the amount involved. 

In November last year, GST on 178 daily use products including chocolates and cocoa-based products was slashed to 18% from 28% as the government sought to ease the burden on consumers hit by price increases on account of the new tax regime. The government had pushed companies to reduce prices in line with the cuts and ensure the benefits of the move were passed on to consumers.

Nestle said it had made sure to exclude such amounts from its accounting. “In situations where the benefit could not be passed on instantly by reduction in MRP (maximum retail price) or increase in grammage, the amount was set aside to be subsequently passed on and was not reckoned either in sales or in profit,” a Nestle spokesperson said in an email.




The Directorate General of Safeguards (DGS), which has been entrusted with looking into anti-profiteering matters, has been calling on companies that didn’t immediately pass on the benefits of lower GST to do so. In the event that this wasn’t possible on account of stocks having already entered the retail channel with older, higher price tags, companies are required to pay the difference to the central fund.

The Nestle spokesperson said it hadn’t received any notice from the anti-profiteering authority for not passing on the benefits of lower taxes under GST and said it was doing so of its own volition.

“At our request, the authority through its communication has advised us to provisionally deposit the amount computed by us, suo moto, in the consumer welfare fund to be constituted under central GST and furnish the necessary documents,” the spokesperson said. “While we were in the process of taking the next steps to pass on the benefits to consumers, we had a discussion with National Anti-profiteering Authority, which was constructive and we decided to deposit, suo moto, the amount which was set aside.”

The maker of KitKat chocolates, Nescafe coffee and Maggi noodles said the company has taken appropriate measures to pass on the benefits of lower GST to consumers.


FRAMEWORK NEEDEDTax experts said there should be a framework to pass on such profits to the government if companies are unable to reduce prices immediately after tax cuts.

“There should be a mechanism for voluntary payment to the government on account of GST benefit,” said Pratik Jain, indirect tax leader, PwC. At times it is not commercially feasible to reduce price immediately, particularly for stock with preprinted prices, Jain said, adding that some guidance on compliance required by manufacturers in case of reduction in GST rates is needed, particularly for goods already with retailers.

Hindustan Unilever said in January that it will pay .`119 crore as GST benefit accrued to the government toward the consumer safeguard fund after it received a notice from the anti-profiteering body for not passing on the benefits of lower GST rates to the consumer.

Last month, DGS sent notices to Jubilant FoodWorks under the anti-profiteering rules for not passing on tax reduction benefits to Domino’s Pizza customers. Earlier, DGS had sent notices under these regulations to Hardcastle Restaurants, which runs McDonald’s restaurants in west and south India, retailer Lifestyle International and auto firm Honda Motor.

Soon after the GST rates were reduced, companies began releasing ads informing consumers about revised prices, and putting in place software to monitor billing and invoicing at retail stores."

Based on various brokerage recommendations, here are 10 stock strategies that can potentially deliver gains over the next three weeks.


Jay Purohit - Technical & Derivatives Analyst, Centrum Broking

Tech Mahindra | BUY | Target Price: Rs 700–715 | Stop loss: Rs 646
TechM has given a breakout in second week of April and rallied sharply. However, it started moving in a corrective phase from last three weeks. The correction seems to be over as the stock is rebounding after retesting the ‘Breakout Trendline’, which also coincides with the ‘SuperTrend’ indicator on daily chart. Since the momentum oscillator ‘RSI’ is placed positively along with the set of moving averages on daily timeframe, we are expecting a rally towards Rs 700–715 in coming days. Thus, any decline towards Rs 655 should be used as a buying opportunity with a stop-loss of Rs 646.


GAIL | BUY | Target Price: Rs 375–385 | Stop loss: Rs 325
The ‘200 EMA’ on daily chart and ‘55 EMA’ on weekly chart acted as a strong support for the stock in the last couple of years. Recently, the stock has again taken the support around the mentioned moving averages and started rebounding. The consolidation of last ten weeks has resulted in formation of an ‘Inverse Head & Shoulder’ pattern on daily chart. 

On Monday, we witnessed a breakout from the mentioned pattern with decent volumes. Looking at these technical evidences, we are expecting a rally towards 375–385 levels in coming 2-3 weeks. Thus, long positions can be taken at the current juncture as well as on declines to Rs 335 with a stop-loss of Rs 325.


Subash Gangadharan, Technical/Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities

ICICI Bank | BUY | Target Price: Rs 355 | Stop loss: Rs 290
ICICI Bank is one of the strongest stocks in the market currently. This week, the stock broke out of the Rs 274-295 trading range on the back of above average volumes. The stock also trades above the 13-day and 50-day SMA. Daily and weekly momentum readings are in rising mode and not extremely overbought. 


Hindustan Oil Exploration | BUY | Target Price: Rs 155 | Stop loss: Rs 121
Hind Oil Exploration has rallied smartly and broken above its recent highs of Rs 129.2 in the process. The stock also trades above the 13-day and 50-day SMA. Daily momentum readings are in rising mode and not extremely overbought.


Vaishali Parekh, Research Analyst, Technical Research, Prabhudas Lilladher

BPCL | BUY | Target Price: Rs 450 | Stop loss: Rs 375
The stock has witnessed a decent erosion from the peak of around Rs 545 and has bottomed out at around Rs 375 levels, consolidating for some time to see a positive bias developing and producing a bullish candle pattern in daily chart. The chart looks attractive for a decent rise from here on, with the RSI indicating a trend reversal recently and also the MACD showing a positive trigger for an upmove. With rising volume participation witnessed, we recommend a buy in this stock. 


Bajaj Finance | BUY | Target Price: Rs 1,975 | Stop loss : Rs 1,800
The stock has gradually corrected from its peak of Rs 1,960 to give a bottoming out indication at around Rs 1,820 levels and currently a positive bullish candle pattern indicates an uptrend with a positive bias. RSI is showing a trend reversal to signal a buy. The stock has maintained above the significant 50DMA and we anticipate a rise from here on to scale till Rs 1,970 levels.


Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in

Nestle | BUY | Target Price: Rs 10,600 | Stop loss: Rs 8,900
With new life time highs, this counter appears to be on the verge of a fresh breakout above its 3-month old ascending channel, which can throw up a target placed around Rs 10,600 levels. Hence, positional traders shall make use of this opportunity to go long at current prices and accumulate further between Rs 9,200–9,100 levels if available for a target of Rs 10,600 with a stop loss of Rs 8,900.


Firstsource Solutions | BUY | Target Price: Rs 78 | Stop loss: Rs 63
With a fresh breakout on price and volume front after recent results, this counter looks poised to head much higher levels. Hence, traders should make use of current consolidation phase to buy now and accumulate at lower levels on declines up to Rs 65 for a target of Rs 78.


NIIT | BUY | Target Price: Rs 121 | Stop loss: Rs 103
After the recent surge from the lows of Rs 84, this counter is in a multi-week corrective and consolidation phase and appears to have hit a bottom after testing its 50-day EMA in last session. Hence, positional traders can create longs with a stop below Rs 103 on closing basis for a target of Rs 121.


Milan Vaishnav, CMT, MSTA 

Emami | BUY | Target Price: Rs 1,125 | Stop loss: Rs 1,018
In the recent past, the stock has grossly underperformed not only the general markets but also the FMCG pack. After resisting near the confluence of 100-DMA and 200-DMA, the stock has attempted to find a temporary bottom near the Rs 1,030-1,050 zones. Though this may not signal the reversal of trend, a technical pullback is likely. 

RSI has just moved above 30 from an oversold situation and this is bullish. On Weekly Charts, RSI forms a higher bottom and is seen reversing. A candle with a long lower shadow resembling a not-so-classical hammer has emerged on weekly charts. It has emerged near the support area of 200-period Moving Average and therefore, holds significance. It is also confirmed by higher than average volumes. Some upward revision of price can be expected in this stock.


Coal India | BUY | Target Price: Rs 285 | Stop loss: Rs 262
For the last couple of months, the stock has not made any major headway and is trading in a broad range of Rs 262- 299 zones. The stock has tested the lower support level of this trading range and looks for a technical pullback. A buy signal over stochastic has emerged with a bullish divergence against the price. RSI has just moved above the oversold area and this is bullish. We might see stock staging a technical pullback even if it continues to remain in the present broad trading range.

24,2018-05-16,Nestle,"Emkay Global Financial Services has an accumulate call on Nestle India Ltd. with a target price of Rs 10100. The current market price of Nestle India Ltd. is Rs 9513.05 Time period given by analyst is year when Nestle India Ltd. price can reach defined target. 
 Nestle India Ltd., incorporated in 1959, is a large-cap food processing company with a market cap of Rs 92052.42 crore.


Investment rational by Emkay Global
Nestle reported a robust quarter with EBITDA and net profit growth of 35% and 40%, respectively, which was ahead of our expectations by 7%. Comparable sales grew by 13% to Rs27.5bn, in line with expectations. However, operating margin witnessed strong improvement of 440bps, led by lower input costs and cost savings.  Sales growth was driven by broad-based growth across categories and is indicative of near double-digit volume growth. 

We expect the growth momentum to sustain on the back of Nestle’s faster product and channel expansion with entry into new categories. Softer input prices and cost efficiencies will result in margin expansion and stronger earnings growth going ahead.
With the strong Q1CY18 performance, we increase our earnings estimates by 2-3%. The stock trades at 40x June’20E earnings and 25x June’20E EBITDA, which is still at a discount to peers. Maintain ACCUMULATE with a revised TP of Rs10,100 (from Rs9,900)."
23,2018-05-16,Nestle,"After ET reported last week that there was no mention of India at the Berkshire Hathaway’s widely-tracked annual shareholders’ meeting on May 5 in Omaha, several disappointed readers — including market participants — took umbrage, aiming their ire at Warren Buffett, the USfirm’s iconic chairman who has a die-hard following in the global investment community. Some of the responses were on these lines: “India will grow irrespective of what Buffett thinks”, “Does Buffett’s views on India really matter?”, “Buffett does not understand India”, and so on. Some of what the readers felt could be true, but Buffett’s inadvertent snub to India needs to be seen through the lens of his pet theory — moat investing — that has been under attack from formidable critics led by Tesla chief Elon Musk.

Those who attended or followed Berkshire shareholders’ meeting did not miss Buffett’s drift towards China as an investment destination. Buffett has mostly preferred the US to invest, though he has made a few bets outside in countries like China and Israel in recent years. For those wanting to understand why India still does not figure in Buffett’s list and why China does, it would be useful to touch upon the theory of moat investing.

Historically, a moat has been the water surrounding a fort or a castle as a protection against invasion. Forts with wider and deeper moats were considered stronger. In investing parlance, a moat refers to a company’s ability to have a competitive advantage over its competitors that will help it maintain its market share. It gives longterm profit visibility. Some examples of economic moats are great trusted brands, patents and industries with high entry barriers and monopolies.

In the US, new technology behemoths such as Apple, Google and Amazon have built deep moats around them for the time being with all of them commanding sizeable market share in their respective bailiwicks. These companies have replaced long-time stalwarts such as Coca-Cola, P&G and IBM as flagbearers of moat investing after the water around them started showing signs of drying in recent years, thanks to competition. Buffett, who struggled to come to terms with the new technologies, finally invested in Apple, the iPhone maker, in 2016.

Other than the US, China is the only other country with companies that command huge market shares. The eye-popping ascent of Chinese upstarts — Alibaba and Tencent — and their emergence as technology giants have caught the attention of global investors. These companies command huge exclusive market share in China. So, it should not surprise why Buffett has trained his sights on the country. After all, he has $140 billion to deploy. When asked about emerging markets at the Berkshire shareholders’ meeting, Buffett said his problem is size, not the geography.

So, it comes as no surprise why India does not appear in Buffett’s scheme of things. India is still some distance away from China in terms of size — China’s GDP is $12 trillion and India’s $2.5 trillion.

It goes without saying that several Indian companies have made big money for shareholders over the last several years, but very few of them have succeeded in creating a sustainable model that falls into the definition of a moat. Domestic companies, which have seen the biggest growth in market capitalisation and have attained scale, have mostly been banks, service providers or franchisees. Companies such as Nestle and Bosch that have been able to command big market shares are arms of multinational companies. In these companies, investors like Buffett would prefer the parent. Some domestic companies which enjoy a strong competitive advantage for now are either too small or have been bogged down by corporate governance problems. Meanwhile, firms with huge competitive advantage, like large private sector banks, are trading at astounding valuations.

The concept of moat should not be seen from the point of investing alone. It is a byproduct of the extent of innovation in a country. It is usually the product that is a moat and not the distribution network. Few Indian companies enjoy such competitive advantage because innovation is not encouraged by most investors in India. Unless local brands with a potential to reach the global audience are created, there is little scope for serious moat investing in India."
26,2018-05-17,Nestle,"We are on the cusp of a consumption cycle, so believes Ravi Dharamshi, CIO, ValueQuest Investment Advisors. Consumer stocks can see a compounded profit growth of 15 per cent plus over the next five years, says Dharamshi talking to ET Now.

What is the difference in the market in 2017 and 2018?
The 2017 market was one huge wave that picked up all the boats. That is going to be missed this year. It is going to be more selective and more stock oriented.


It was a wave in 2017 and now that wave has come down to only 50-60 stocks. In April and May, it has come down to 15 stocks. Why are the markets getting so polarised and why are the leaders getting more and more expensive?
Because of the wave in 2016-2017, a lot of the anticipated improvement in the micros got factored in. We had front-loaded returns in a lot of the areas and despite the fact that those improvements are happening, there is an adjustment in that multiple, because we ran ahead of time. The only place where there is a surprise over and above what was anticipated are the stocks that are doing well. Clearly, consumer discretionary is one space which has surprised dramatically in this result season.


There is a buzz in the market that PMS fund managers are feeling the heat now. What has been your experience?
Touchwood! We have avoided the landmines. That is not to say that we are doing way better than the market or any such ting but none of those bombs that have exploded in the market have been in our portfolio. So, that is the good part. 

It is definitely a challenging time because of the margin increase. Because of the rally previous year, there is a lot of money that flowed in last year and that has not seen returns. That by itself will put a lot of pressure on the midcap, small cap space but that is a generalisation. Within that midcap, small cap space, can you find 10, 20, 30 stocks that can deliver good returns even from here over a two-three year period? I think, we can. So, you have to avoid those land mines that is rule number one. 

Rule number two, you have to look for companies where there is a good risk reward even from here with the three-year point of view.


Would you say forget about chasing growth, let us keep it safe? 
No, I would just put it in a different way. Do not chase growth where the growth is very visible and obvious, go for places where the growth is yet to come. The growth is in 2019 and 2020. Those companies which are not growing today but where the macros are changing in their favour. For example, the rupee is depreciating and a tailwind is developing for exporters. Utilisations levels of companies are going up to 75%-80% and that means, the capex cycle is coming up. It may be a year down the line. Those are the places where one should be positioned for growth that is going to come in FY20 and not the growth that is happening as we speak today.


You have this reputation of being a pharma bull how. Would you defend that reputation?
Why should I defend the reputation? We have been lucky to avoid all the explosion that has happened. Our allocations have come down significantly. We have remained only with the stories where we believe that there is significant upside with a three-year point of view. My portfolio does not reflect 100% pharma.


So, you like pharma selective. We should not brand you as the pharma bull on D-Street?
No, no. We got lucky from 2010 to 2015 when the best place was pharma. I would not claim that we avoided or have completely gotten out of it post that but it is okay. The damage is limited and our winners are still holding onto substantial gains.


Let me take the clock back to May 2017. What was the construct of your portfolio and what is the construct of portfolio now? What has changed in terms of positioning ideology and approach?
We have reduced weightage in pharmaceuticals. 12 months back, we added a lot of consumption stocks in rural consumer theme -- companies that were undergoing trouble within the consumer space. Today obviously they are doing very well but from this point onwards, I am trying to position in small cap, IT, midcap IT and particularly product companies. We are positioning ourselves even on the size of the capex on the product side. 

Then there is the financial inclusion themes where some sector has undergone trouble last year and all spaces which are not doing very well as of today but where we feel that 12 to 18 months down the line, they will do well. That is where we are positioning ourselves.


You are betting on small banks, you are betting on capex but you are not buying road companies or construction companies. You are buying ancillaries, second derivatives like pump companies and companies on those categories. You are selectively betting on IT product companies. Why do you like them?
We had an entire dotcom boom which lifted the services model. The sizes of these service companies have become humungous compared to an IT product company’s. They have remained at $80-, $100-, $120 -million kind of size. So, the boom never happened for the product companies. This is a long gestation business. It requires you to invest continuously in developing those products over a 8-10-year period. 

Today we can say they have reached a place where they have the marquee clientele in the developed markets where they are getting those reference deals where people are actually recommending their product. They are competing with Oracles of the world and they have finally come to a stage where they can compete. They do not yet have a cash flow throwing business model. So, there is a little bit of chasm to cross over here. If you believe that Indian entrepreneur and Indian IT skill are here and there is an explosion of IT requirement in the world, though it has become more digital, more consumer facing and more into mobile and data analytics and robotics, you have to find companies that are positioned for the future. 

I am sure there will be at least a couple of winners out of this IT product space over the next five to 10 years.


I can only think of five or six IT product companies?
 There are not too many.


So, you have bought those five, six companies which are there?
Yes, there are not too many. But I believe IT services model has run its course. There is a lot or reinvention that is required over there. They might have a cyclical tailwind but if I were to bet with a five to 10-year point of view, I am more comfortable with the product companies.


Banks account for bulk of the market cap in NASDAQ. We are aware what is going on with some of the FANG stocks. If there is a selling in FANG stocks because those are considered as product companies or consumer companies, could that have an impact on back home Indian IT product companies then?
Right now, they are too small to make such a big difference. There can be a fall in the FANG stocks and I have been constantly tweeting about it as well that the valuations are on a high. I do not think a fall in market caps over there will lead to second derivative impact on the IT product companies. This is too far-fetched. They are too small and inconsequential right now.


The second theme which you like is financial inclusion as a megatrend. Within that, you like small banks. Why?
Yes. Just to give you a broad big picture, India has the largest pool of underbanked population in the world. If just the underbanked population was a country, we would be the eighth largest in terms of population. The unbanked masses through the Jan Dhan Yojana, have become part of the formal system, the mainstream economy. Which are the businesses, which are the banks or the models that are going to cater to these people? I am not talking about only people below the poverty line, I am talking about bottom of the pyramid which includes slightly below Rs 2 lakh annual household income. 

Small finance bank is one model which is positioned to cater to these people. The mindset is different. Most of them are converts from microfinance institutions. They are more service-oriented and accustomed to what the customer needs. They have gone through a crisis because of demonetisation and are just coming out of that. 

The base for them is very low and the runway is very huge over the next 10-15-year period. This is somewhat similar to buying a private bank in early 2000. Let us say you align with an IndusInd or a Kotak, that is the kind of runway. Now in hindsight it is very easy to see oh, yeah you should have bet on one of those private banks. So, this is a private bank. A small finance bank is a stop-gap arrangement. Five years down the line, they will be eligible for becoming a universal bank. They have built the cost into their structure of being a bank. They are yet to reap the benefit of the growth that this space, niche can provide.


Again, it is a very small universe right now. There were microfinance companies which have become banks now and they include Ujjivan, Equitas, AU Financials. So, you are pretty much hunting in these two, three names?
 We have some private equity deals also and of course seven or eight or those that got license and not are listed will be coming to the market in the next two, three years. The RBI mandate is to get listed within a three-year timeframe. I believe the space will increase in terms of number of players also.


A year ago, I learned that you have bought into consumer stocks. I always thought you were a value investor, focussed on price and you were never of the view that you should chase businesses. But consumer staples are expensive and you still own them. So, it is a good call. I am sure it has worked for you but where do you think HUL, Nestle or Maricos and the Emamis of the world are headed after the recent run?
You are absolutely right they are expensive and nobody can deny that. But from a larger point of view, we are probably at the beginning of a consumption cycle. What keeps me invested is the possibility that they can provide a 15% plus kind of compounded profit growth. That is what we look at. 

There is no concern about the management or any such thing over there, the only thing that you are worried about is whether the business will grow 10%, 15% or 20%. We believe that the trajectory for the next five years is still on a higher side than on the lower side for these businesses."
29,2018-05-23,Nestle,"Your infant may have unknowingly been exposed to potential health risks due to commercial compulsions. Almost three decades after strict laws were instituted to control the marketing and promotion of baby foods in India, aggressive promotions to doctors by companies, including Nestle, Abbott and Danone, through conferences, conventions, digital platforms and freebies, continue unabated, thereby creating a health hazard for millions of babies.

Though several regulations and an International Code to curb unscrupulous promotions and marketing of infant food exists here in India, ironically nearly half the infants under six months are not exclusively breastfed a rate that has not improved substantially in two decades.

This indicates that aggressive marketing of breast-milk substitutes continues to undermine efforts to improve breastfeeding rates, and to an unhealthy nexus that exists between companies and healthcare professionals, to influence established outcomes.

The International Code adopted by World Health Assembly in May 1981, followed by Indian laws — Infant Milk Substitutes (IMS) Feeding Bottles, and Infant Foods (Regulation of Production, Supply and Distribution) Act 1992 — ban any kind of promotion and sponsorship by health workers of baby food, infant milk substitutes and feeding bottles.

However, data shared with TOI shows that over the years companies have been aggressively promoting and marketing baby food through conferences and conventions, exotic trips and even offering discounts on e-commerce sites like Amazon, discountkart and Infibeam. RTI details show that Nestle, Danone, Abbott among others, sponsored the National Conference of Indian Society of Clinical Nutrition held in Delhi-based Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences in October 2016.





Other examples of fraudulent practices include neonatal workshop in 2016 at Cloudnine Hospital being sponsored by Nestle, Abbott and Mead Johnson Nutrition, while Mead Johnson offered to sponsor an International Neonatology Conference in Madrid in December 2017. In fact, there are several examples of nutritional conferences being sponsored by food companies, including Nestle, health activists say.

Recently, concerns are being raised by activists on Danone using Docplexus, a digital platform of doctors, to promote its brand and advertise products, as well as its health claims, which is also banned under the IMS Act.

Popular baby food brands sold here include Lactogen, Cerelac, Nestum (Nestle), Farex and Dexolac (Danone), and Similac (Abbott Nutrition).

Promotion — targeted at children aged between 0-2 years — of any kind of baby foods and feeding bottles, including advertisements, inducements on sales, pecuniary benefits to doctors, including sponsorship, is banned under the IMS Act. The Act was enacted by the Parliament in 1992 to control marketing of baby foods that was recognised to be a health hazard causing high morbidity and mortality among infants and young children, and later strengthened in 2003 to cover babies up to 2 years of age.

The Act says “no person shall advertise for the distribution, sale or supply of infant milk substitutes, feeding bottles or infant foods; or give an impression that feeding of infant milk substitutes and infant foods are equivalent to, or better than, mother’s milk; or take part in the promotion of infant milk substitutes, feeding bottles or infant foods”.

“Breastfeeding has long been recognised to be normal food for babies and critical for their health, survival and development during early years, and no mother should be pushed to adopt formula feeding at the hospital. There is strong evidence that baby food companies aggressively promote the use of their products directly or indirectly disregarding the International Code or national legislations. Governments need to act decisively to enforce regulations to put an end to all kinds of promotions of foods for infants and young children,” said Dr Arun Gupta, Regional Coordinator of International Baby Food Action Network (IBFAN), Asia, which works on child malnutrition through improved infant feeding practices, told TOI.

Medical research from Nepal, Ghana, and India suggest that early initiation of breastfeeding reduces neonatal mortality by 44% among infants surviving at least 48 hours, and is especially beneficial for preventing sepsis-related deaths. Baby food companies including Danone and Abbott say they strictly adhere to Indian regulations, and are committed to ethical marketing.

In response to specific “charges”, a Danone spokesperson said Docplexus is an online platform for doctors only, no consumer has access to this information and hence there is no violation of the IMS Act. Confirming it participated in the NNF conference in October 2017, she added, FSMP (food for special medical purposes) medical nutrition products were discussed.

Queries mailed to Nestle remained unanswered.

Dr RK Anand, paediatrician and founder, Consumers’ Action on Safety and Health (ACASH), who was instrumental in the 80s for pushing the government into formulating the Infant Milk Substitute Act said, “Companies have been flouting rules for decades by unethically marketing infant food. Mothers are not being guided properly and, in fact, could be misled regarding breastfeeding. Hence companies need to be monitored. Counselling and support by doctors is required to help new mothers so that they adopt good breastfeeding practices.”

Over 27 million containers of infant formula of 400gm each are sold every year in India meant for babies between zero to six months, the number is staggering — almost equal to the number of babies born, and plays a disrupting role in breastfeeding practices, at nascent stage, experts added, saying cases filed by IBFAN, are languishing in courts."
28,2018-05-23,Nestle,"MUMBAI: A bunch of heavyweights including France’s Danone, Hindustan Unilever and Nestle are competing with US private equity giant KKR & Co to acquire GlaxoSmithKline plc’s 72 per cent stake in its Indian consumer products division, GSK Consumer Healthcare, in a massive $4-billion deal, the biggest in the Indian consumer industry.

PepsiCo, Abbott, ITC and Mondelez are the other contenders, for the stake, which has been on block after the UK-based multinational pharma giant started mobilising resources to fund its $13-billion acquisition of Novartis’ consumer products.

The initial bids have come and talks are at an early stage, said sources with direct knowledge of the matter.

The transaction, perhaps the biggest in Indian consumer history, is expected to gather pace in June when the indicative bids turn into formal non-binding ones and the company shortlists contenders for the second round of negotiations, sources said.

As per Monday’s market value, 72 per cent of GSK is worth around Rs 17,980 crore and the deal could include an open offer to minority shareholders of GSK Consumer Healthcare.

Danone has hired Lazard as its financial advisor. GSK, which holds some of the best-selling consumer brands including Boost and Horlicks, has hired two US banks to manage the stake sale process.

Mondelez, Nestle, ITC, Abbott, HUL, KKR and Danone declined to comment. Mails sent to Pepsi also remained unanswered.

While GSK said it won’t comment on market speculations, the company had said on March 27 that it would assess its Indian consumer healthcare subsidiary as it looks to fund a buyout of Novartis’ stake in their global consumer healthcare joint venture.

“The purpose of the review is to assess the strategic options for our wellknown and highly valued nutrition brands, including Horlicks and Boost. These brands are licensed and distributed through GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare Ltd, a publicly listed company in India in which GSK owns 72.5 per cent stake. We are conducting this strategic review in support of our transaction to buy out the Novartis stake in our Consumer Healthcare joint venture with Novartis. We expect the outcome of the strategic review to be concluded around the end of 2018. There can be no assurance that the review process will result in any transaction,” it said on March 27.

For companies such as Danone, HUL, ITC and Abbott, GSK’s consumer division looks pretty much in line with their product portfolio and could be the best strategic fit.

KKR, which rose to global prominence with its $25-billion historic takeover of US food and tobacco giant RJR Nabisco in 1989, is one of the most aggressive private equity investors in India. The New York-based firm, which has raised a record $9.3 billion Asia fund, has been looking for big-ticket strategic assets in India.

Analysts expect the sale of Horlicks brand, or sale of Indian products.

“We assign a high probability of a global sale of the Horlicks brand, or a slump sale of Malted Food Drink (MFD) brands in India (Horlicks, Boost etc) and allied assets (excluding distribution infrastructure). We believe minority shareholders in India (GSK plc holds 73 per cent in GSK Consumer India) may be appropriately compensated if the parent sells the Horlicks brand globally,” Deutsche Bank said in a note on March 21."

30,2018-05-26,Nestle,"Given a wide market and lower coffee penetration, there is only one room and that is the room to grow, says Suresh Narayanan, CMD, Nestle India. He told ET Now that the secular nature of growth is satisfying and it has been across categories.

Edited excerpts:


You have had a stellar quarterly performance. I think you have stunned Street with a 60 per cent gross margin uptick. How are you going to sustain that?

It is ultimately the team, the partners, the distributors and everybody else who have made the results happen. It has been a very satisfying first quarter. And what is satisfying, especially is the secular nature of the growth, it has been across categories. 

Normally, you would expect one or two categories to give us the growth, but this has been a growth across categories. So, milk and nutrition has grown, Maggi and the whole prepared food portfolio has also grown, chocolates and confectionery has grown and also the coffee and beverages have grown in volume terms. 

What is important is to go back to the original strategy that we had set for ourselves which is very simple, which is to increase the salience of consumption through increased penetration and increased volume. So, that is really where the rubber hits the road and that is really where I believe that the team has done a terrific job. Our reported sales are at about 6.3 per cent. If you look at the comparable growth number taking GST into account, it is about 13.4 per cent. 

The volume increase together with new launches and products has led to these happy results that we have had to report for the first quarter.

Nestle is paying a lot of money, over $7 billion to sell Starbucks products across the world. Does India feature in that plan?

Look, as of now, I am as much privy to the news as you are. There is clearly a global understanding for the sale. This is what the announcement has been, let us watch and wait the space. 


I cannot believe your parent has not told you about where India features, it being a very important market for them?

Well, well, the parent is very clear, the parent has announced the birth of the new deal and I believe that as you might have read also that, the deal is to be fully consummated by the end of this year. Therefore, let us watch the space and I am sure we will have numerous interactions when we will share it with you.


As far as the coffee space goes, it is a space that is dominated by Nestle as well as HUL at the moment. I see a lot of Nescafe around in your office, how are you going to prevent the cannibalisation of Nescafe?

Well, you see, coffee has got different offerings. There is mainstream coffee, instant coffee that we have, there is premium coffee that we have, there is potion coffee which is there and there also brands like an Espresso which we do not sell in India, but which is also there. 

So, I think it is fair to say each of the product dimensions we have got to offer has got a distinct proposition and it appeals to consumers and connoisseurs, depending on what coffee experience or what beverage experience they are looking forward to. So, honestly, in a market as wide as it is and with the kind of lower levels of penetration of coffee, there is only one room and that is the room to grow. 


Have you given a new target, can you share what it is, what is it that you are looking at as far as coffee goes and can we expect new product launches?

Well, coffee clearly has been one of the star performers of the first quarter. I am happy to report that we have had very strong double-digit volume growth in coffee across geographies. Clearly, for us, it is an area which is as our global CEO has also put as one of the priority products in our portfolio. You will see that in due course of time we will be accelerating the pace of launches and premiumisation that we can play in the coffee space.


So, you will enter the premium market whether it is for an Espresso, for example, which is quite popular in the luxury segment?

Look, within instant coffee itself, I think there are opportunities that we are looking at.


And that is all for this. For the rest, you follow the different financial model...

Well, we will. One of the things that we have talked about in the past as well is the company is really valorising the power of innovation and renovation and in that cycle, the premiumisation of coffee also figures.


There is no doubt that you have also benefited from deflation of food articles, you have seen input prices go down. Look how milk is doing at the moment, that must have been a big contributor for the good results as well.

Sure. I think a benign commodity space price together with scale benefits because coming out of the Maggi issue we have increased our volume now. I think the advantages of scale also play into it. Part of the margin, of course, is also because of the base effect. GST because of the lower base effect also has contributed to the overall spread as far as the profitability is concerned.


You have mentioned GST, but I have to ask you how Nestle and a couple of other FMCG companies have been hauled up by the government, notices have been sent out for denying benefits of the lower GST to consumers, cheques apparently have been submitted, where does this entire controversy stand and why did not you pass on the benefits to your consumers?

Well, I think, let me clarify if you think then I will say it as succinctly and as simply as I can. Number one, is that as far as the word hauled is concerned, I am sorry but it is nowhere being hauled up. The discussions that we have had with the anti-profiteering authority have been extremely cordial, extremely professional, extremely candid and extremely transparent.

There is no question for an issue of a notice of any kind of misdemeanour that has been done. This was a discussion around how GST benefits have been passed on. We were committed and we were one of the first companies to announce that we are committed to passing on the benefits of GST down the stream. 

Now, obviously there are operational issues as well when you pass on these benefits because the fact of the matter is that if there is, for example, on a brand a 50 paise benefit, it is very difficult to pass on a 50-paise benefit because of the issues of coinage. 

Similarly, in some cases, if you change the grammage of the product, it changes the taste of the product and then you have a double whammy that you are giving extra grammage. But the consumer says look I do not like the taste of this product. So, these are all the practicalities which we have also explained and there is therefore a lead time...


Why did you change the grammage, I do not understand?

Well, because if you are not able to change a price point, you can either offer value to the consumer in two ways; either give more of the product or give it at a lower price. So, either of these options is available to a company.


The question of just cutting down the price...
 Well, cutting down the price, if I were to, for example, look at a category where I get a benefit of let's say 5 per cent and that translates into a price impact of 45 naya paise or 50 naya paise. How am I going to pass it on? Even if I pass it on, there is no way in which the transaction is going to happen as far as the trade is concerned. 

So, these are some of the practical issues. In the case of new production of stock, there was clearly a lead time for the right reasons, for operational reasons that you have to print the packaging material, produce it and produce the packs and put into the market. Then that goes and reaches the trade. So, in the interregnum, the amount of money that was involved is the discussion that we had with the antiprofiteering authority and suo motu we offered that you kindly suggest to us what do we do as far as this fund is concerned. 


So, have you given that cheque?

What we have really done is the anti-profiteering authority has referred this matter to the Director General of Safeguards who are having a discussion with us on the quantum. 

What kind of a quantum is the conversation?

Let me not give that at the moment because it is still undergoing the process of verification. I believe that the company is here in terms of its ethics, standards of compliance and governance to ensure we will do the very best to see that the benefits are passed on suitably. 

And I think this is the spirit in which it being done. Once we get to know which account and how and when, the modalities get worked out.


But you did not set aside any money in the...

We have set aside. This money is not reflected in the results.


How much have you set aside that is part of your results?

It is not part of the results. What is reflected in my results is the 38 per cent improvement in profit after tax that you are seeing and the top line. These are set aside and these amounts are in the privy of the anti-profiteering authority.


If there is one play that is doing very well in stock markets or is the flavour of the season, it's clearly the consumption story. I think all FMCG companies, all the consumption related stocks, for example, have posted very good earnings. So is that the trend that is going to continue? Do you think you will carry on with the kind of earnings that you have displayed in the quarter and maybe even grow on it?

Look, I would not like to comment since we do not give any guidance on the future results of the company. I would like to say I think the consumption space is a very interesting space and in fact, as you yourself have rightly alluded, most of our peer groups have also declared good results. This is a consumption economy and the core of the economy remains consumption.

Consumption is a strong story. The kind of growth that we have seen on average in the last year or so has been in terms of volumes which are in high single digits. I do not see that this is going to substantially decelerate unless of course there is an economic headwind. 

So, obviously things like the oil prices or the rupee would have some impact on this. But as of now, on the assumption of the reported satisfactory monsoon, increased government spending, the benefits of the Pay Commission, increased urbanisation and aspiration, opening up of tier-2 and tier-3 towns, I still believe that consumption will be a relatively strong story for this economy. 


And what about some analysts who always fear that maybe Nestle is not well suited to capitalise on the rural growth and the recovery we are seeing in rural India, what do you have to say?

Look, the fact of the matter is that we have a portfolio and we developed the portfolio in order to address the segment of consumers who best choose the brands that we seek to offer. Now, it is fair to say that for the rural play of Nestle, we do have products in rural India. But our rural play is probably lower than some of the other peer group companies. 

As far as we are concerned, I think urban India and the next 600 towns that are being talked about in both the McKinsey and other reports, I think there is enough opportunity for companies like Nestle to, in fact, grow in the market.


So, is that also a conscious decision also because your strategy will not be negative on the margins?

No, see any growth strategy has to be sustainable. Sustainable means that you have to have both a top line and a bottom line that you can carry sustainably into the future. 

As far as we are concerned, our introduction of products, our play on nutrition, our play on valued added products are all with a very clear direction to ensure we increase penetration and volumes and offer value to the consumer. This also benefits in terms of generating the fuel for growth and profitability. 

So, there will not be a compromise of one for the other."

33,2018-05-30,Nestle,"Raising money was the easier process in 2016 and 2017. Deploying money was more difficult. Today, it is rightly balanced out, Kenneth Andrade, Founder & CIO, Old Bridge Capital, tells ET NowEdited excerpts:


Is it true that you are still running a portfolio with no financials in them?
Yes, since the inception of the portfolio, we have not had a single financial named up there.


The space where you hunt -- the smallcaps and the midcaps -- has corrected. I interacted with you closer to Diwali last year and at that time you were not very gung-ho about the valuations. Do you have decent enough confidence and lot of margin of safety to be a buyer once again?
Over the last couple of years, markets have been getting a lot of liquidity. There have been no alternative avenues to deploy incremental capital and most of the money has come into equity assets. It has been a challenge to put a portfolio together because you are always chasing good names and quality names which is bidding up the prices or the valuations. 

Since start of this calendar year till date, things have ebbed out a bit. For the first time, there is a lot of comfort in terms of visiting new business opportunities, taking time to evaluate how sustainable their business models are and how strong their cash flows are. This is a market that works for long-term investors. As I said, the valuations may not have corrected that dramatically but it is giving you time to put your process into play. Going by the corporate India stance, a big part of that balance sheet clean up is already over. The amount of cash that is getting generated in the individual balance sheets are far higher than what was seen in the last couple of years. And this is after you had big financial events happening on ground in 2017.

All put together, the environment for investing is extremely good. Not the entire market is up there. There are a large number of companies that are hitting 52-week lows and some of them are hitting all-time lows. These are good businesses and industries which are significantly large. So yes, it is moderately better in 2018 and I am sure if you get a portfolio together this year. the next couple of years should not be such an issue in terms of generating incremental returns.


Do you think that the fall that has gripped the midcaps for the better part of May is over and done with? What signs are you picking up that led by variables, you might see midcaps and smallcaps bottoming out with a large portion of the selling being done?
There are two elements to it. One is the liquidity that is coming into the cycle. By liquidity, I mean the amount of stocks coming into the cycle and the fundamentals of the business itself. As far as liquidity is concerned, over last two-three years, mutual funds have gotten a significant amount of capital on their books and they have been deploying money into this part of the market. The cycle started off in 2013. So, midcaps and smallcaps started off in 2013 and then on, there has just been a secular run in businesses. Earnings went up. Also, you had valuations steer up. All of that was corrected this year. 

We need to look for a bounce-back in profitability or earnings. We are seeing that stabilise in FY2018 and FY19-20. Even if profitability goes up by 5% or 6%, which is equivalent to GDP growth, what happens on the denominator depends on the capital employed. Since the capital employed is going to remain static, it effectively means that your return on equity and your return on capital employed is moving up. 

All the companies that you are talking about, whether they are largecaps, midcaps or even smallcaps, the incremental capital efficiency is going to remain so elevated that a lot of these companies will command a premium in the environment. I am not too worried about quality businesses or good companies out there, going lower in terms of price earnings multiple. I want their profitability to bounce back significantly over the next four-year period.


Let us drill it down to specifics because as part of your commentary, you have no investments in technology, pharma and financials. One of your holdings is Hathaway Cables and Datacomp. Explain the rationale because this is a business where a lot of capital is pumped in. It is of long gestation and the costs are high.
When we invest capital, we tend to believe that the businesses are at an inflection point where profitability will be ahead of the capital deployment. The capital intensity of the business is not going to go away but incremental number of subscribers that will come on book are going to be reasonably slower than what you have seen in the past. A lot of the build-up of the debt works have already taken place and that is what is happening with the entire space out there.

A large part of the networks are already built and most of these companies and most of the assets are already positioned in terms of monetising them over the next two or three years with new streams of revenue and new streams of business opportunities.

From a price point and from a replacement cycle also, some of these companies are trading at virtually replacement cost. That is what we like about any business which we touch and this is one business that fits the requirements. As the whole environment is stressed, one cannot get hypercompetitive which means in the medium term, you will have some incremental pricing power. All of that will go to the bottom line that is as far as the income statements are concerned. 

On the balance sheet side, you have already seen a large part of the investment already in play. So, balance sheet growth will not be as high as you have seen in the past. These are two variables that we look for in any of the categories that we invest in and that is how we put most of our money to work.


Currently. markets are rewarding companies which are growing without raising capital, consumer companies may be brand owners. What is your view as you have owned some of these names in the past? Companies like Titan, Blue Dart, Nestle and Page Industries what is happening to that end of the market because markets are giving disproportionate amount of weightage to companies which are growing without raising fresh capital?
We were fortunate to be in that decade where the entire consumer basket was going through a cyclical low. In the beginning of the decade or the beginning of the century, companies were struggling with single digit to almost negative growth and we identified a business which is going through a cyclical down cycle and all the consumer names fitted in there. 

At the same time, a lot of these companies had already consolidated their businesses and they were throwing on enormous amount of cash but the markets lack growth and so they were not getting priced in. The result: you had a lot of the infrastructure businesses and cyclicals getting priced at secular valuations. 

An infra contractor virtually got valued at 20 times earnings while some of these consumer businesses were getting priced between 12 times to 20 times earnings and they were throwing out cash. We had an arbitrage of valuations there which as an organisation we put to play.

Consumer names with high efficiency on capital were available at that point in time and the difference between them then and now is that the price earnings multiples have become higher and as an investor I am not willing to make money from buying a business at 30 times and 40 times multiples. 

In a country like India, there is a linear growth in demand and a lot of these companies will continue to grow but as an investor, I need low valuations to start with. But such companies have low growth as well. once we position a portfolio in an industry with both these characteristics. When the cycle comes back, then growth goes higher and price earnings multiples expand. We need both these variable working for us to create the long-term compounding story and we have been finding small pockets that exist in markets. We have been able to find it in virtually every cycle.


Is this one of those markets where you are feeling like a kid in a candy store? You want to buy everything but you do not have the money to buy everything.
I do not think that is the case out here. It is a fairly well discovered market. I do not think there is anything that is not discovered in capital markets today and the easier process in 2017 and 2016 was raising money. Deploying money was more difficult. Today, it is rightly balanced out. You are still getting long-term capital that is coming on book. The ability to buy companies is eased out a bit at this point in time but I cannot say, I feel like a kid in candy store. It is not that environment.


You typically like to buy bad news when it is temporary in nature. Let us say you bought into agrarian and rural businesses a couple of years ago because you saw that as the bombed out part of the economy and if that problem becomes better, then the enablers will start making money. Have you identified any other similar theme?
It has been just about two years since the rural theme has been in play and that trend continues. In 2017, a lot of these companies had valuations that went against them. All of that has normalised in 2018, which is a good point. From an industry standpoint, there is no fresh capacity that has come into the system in any of those verticals that are there. 

From a long-term perspective, supply is still constraint, demand is a question mark and if demand grows higher than what supply is coming in, that part of the economy can still expand itself. We all tend to look for is where the supply constraints are and if demand is growing faster than supply over the medium term, that is where the industry has pricing power. 

We find it in power generation and utilities to an extent. We find it across the media chain because last year was brutal as far as the environment is concerned for both advertising and media businesses. Consumer stocks have bounced back currently. They are almost mid cycle in terms of their rebound. There are spaces that exist. It is not the simplest of markets currently but it is much better than it was in 2016 and 2017 for putting a portfolio to work.


You mentioned that some pharma stocks or companies may make a comeback. Qualify that statement. What kind of businesses do you think would be able to work their way through the problems that they are facing with the US FDA back home and the pricing in the generics market overseas. The rupee’s weakness would help in building their competitive advantage towards other supplies in emerging markets. But where is the turnaround expected?
The first thing to look for is leadership in the entire industry losing profitability. When that happens, usually the bottom end of the entire market or the bottom end of that industry bombs out and no new incremental capacity comes on board. You are mid-way through that down cycle as far as the pharma business is concerned. 

We have avoided that segment for a long period of time but we are looking at individual businesses that are not going for further capex. So, that is the first check box. Second, a lot of existing capacities have started generating revenue though at a lower margin and that puts pressure on a lot of the smaller capacities out there. 

From a regulatory standpoint, pricing is coming down. From a competitive standpoint, prices have already come down and that means that no further capacity will come into the cycle. That makes that sector very interesting. You just have to wait for a couple of years for demands to normalise to the new supplies that have come in. 

Once that happens, some of these companies will come back fairly strongly. We have been looking at elements where there are pockets of opportunity as far as valuations are concerned. We would rather stick with the larger ones though we have not initiated any trade in that sector as of now but the valuations are far better in that business than they ever were in the last six or seven years. The technology business went through a similar cycle two or three years back and we have seen how that as evolved in 2018. It is a call that you take on cyclical downside and put a portfolio to work and that is what we try to do on a continuous basis."

8,2018-06-04,Nestle,"MUMBAI: Hindustan Unilever (HUL), the country largest consumer goods firm, plans to launch traditional South Asian breakfast options such as khichdi, upma and pongal in a pronounced deviation from its earlier strategy to familiarise the Indian shopper with a more global menu, which included noodles and pre-mixed soups.

The new products, made of millets such as jowar and bajra under its ayurveda brand Ayush, will mainly compete with MTR, Kellogg's, PepsiCo and Marico in the Rs 3,000-crore breakfast market, where consumers have been switching from western cereals to either traditional Indian or healthier alternatives.

HUL’s entry into the segment is also seen as a pre-emptive move aimed at taking the fight to Patanjali, which sells dalia, corn-flakes and oats but also has plans to launch similar products later this year. The Indian unit of Anglo-Dutch consumer giant, however, said it will address some of the key barriers such as use of preservatives and health concerns around packaged foods that have led to the low consumption of such items in India.

“Lever Ayush Foods marks our entry into the health and naturals food segment. With our brand vision of traditional ingredients being made contemporary, we will be able to democratise the benefits of ayurveda inspired recipes to the Indian consumer and do our part in making India healthy,” said GeetuVerma, executive director - foods at HUL. It is test marketing the new range in Chennai.

In India, the packaged food market is heavily skewed toward biscuits and salty snacks that together is nearly Rs 50,000 crore in size. In comparison, other food segments, especially the breakfast cereal industry, has not made much progress as it has failed to convince Indians to switch their eating habits. When making a choice, Indians have always preferred health to taste. With products such as corn-flakes hit by the convenience and lifestyle trends, there is also a bigger appetite for protein over carbohydrates. “Indians are moving to packaged breakfast options and the main switch is happening between traditional, home cooked breakfast to easier solutions like ready to cook or eat options,” said Aditya Bagri, director at Baggry’s that sells muesli, oats and cornflakes. “There is a segment looking for healthy or functional stuff and also for solutions to our traditional foods made easy.”



Analysts also expect such products to eventually compete with the likes of ubiquitous udipi joints and Irani cafes that cater to most out-of-home breakfast eaters. Some cereal segments have been growing well – especially those perceived as healthy, such as oat-based products that have seen Marico or PepsiCo’s Quaker Oats launching masala variants to cater to the Indian palette.

HUL, which sells brands such as Knorr and Kissan, clocked nearly Rs 1,147 crore from its foods division during FY18. Ayush, which was originally launched in 2001, was relaunched in the personal care space with several mass-market products ranging from toothpaste and skin cream to soaps and shampoos. The market has also seen shifting consumer taste toward natural or herbal brands, mostly in personal care, especially after Patanjali’s entry.

While growth at the Baba Ramdev-led firm has tapered off, newer players could add to competition. Last month, Nestle India announced that it will add breakfast cereals from joint venture Cereal Partners Worldwide to its portfolio."

12,2018-06-05,Nestle,"NEW DELHI: Major companies across sectors, including RB, PepsiCo, Nestle and Hyundai, have pledged to reduce usage of plastics in their businesses and enhance recycling on World Environment Day.

FMCG major RB has committed to make 100 per cent of its plastic packaging to be recyclable or reusable by 2025.

Similarly, food and beverages major PepsiCo India said it would explore ways to scale up recovery and recycling, equivalent to 100 per cent of its post-consumer plastic waste in the next few years.

PepsiCo will also pilot first-ever plant-based, 100 per cent compostable packaging for Lay's and Kurkure snacks products in India.

""The responsible use of plastic for packaging is our overriding aim and we have organised our efforts using the 4R approach- reduce, reuse, replace, and recycle. We are committed to removing or reducing plastic packaging...and investing in research into alternative materials,"" RB said in a statement.

PepsiCo India President and CEO Ahmed ElSheikh said the company has been working to reduce the impact of its packaging on the environment.

""We are committed to working with partners to leverage new technologies and developing sustainable, environmentally friendly packaging solutions,"" he said.

ElSheikh further said, ""...India will be among the first countries to pilot this new, sustainable packaging solution developed by PepsiCo. We plan to launch this pilot in the fourth quarter of 2018.""

Nestle India also said it will continue with its efforts to reduce, recycle and recover towards protecting the environment.

In 2017, the company said it reduced packaging material weight by approximately 1,532 tonnes by ensuring eco designing of packaging in a sustainable way.

""We have initiated projects on waste management by engaging with relevant stakeholders,"" Nestle said, adding it also supported initiatives to recycle or recover energy from used plastic.

Auto major Hyundai Motor India also announced plans to reduce the usage of plastics across all its offices, dealers and service networks.

Commenting on the initiatives, HMIL Director - Sales and Marketing Rakesh Srivastava said: ""This year's theme is 'Beating Plastic Pollution', for which we are exploring green alternatives to reduce the usage of plastics across all our offices, dealers and service networks"".

Hyundai said its initiatives will focus on reducing the usage of plastics at its manufacturing plant in Sriperumbudur near Chennai and across all its 493 Hyundai Dealerships and 1,309 Service Workshops.

The company, along with its vendor partners, will also opt for alternate packaging material for spare parts and usage of water-borne paints.

11,2018-06-05,Nestle,"If you bump into a lanky, blonde and bespectacled American at Borivali railway station during morning rush hour, don’t be puzzled. That’s Josh Woodward, and he knows more about you that you could possibly imagine! Over the past two years, Woodward and his team have been trying to understand how Mumbaikars live — their daily routine, what kind of business they do, what they spend on, how they commute, how often they use their phones and apps or the kind of information they are looking for.

For Woodward, based out of the Mountain View, California headquarters of Google, such deep understanding of microcosms is critical. He’s a group product manager on Google’s Next Billion Users (NBU) team — the motley crew that’s trying to get more people online.

Besides Mumbai, which was the focal point, the teams comprising UI, UX (user interface, user experience) experts, research designers and engineers, spent time in Mathura, Hyderabad, Delhi, Ahmedabad and Bengaluru. They interacted with 1,200 people in Borivali alone — and covered 9,000 people as part of their quest to comprehend the lives of Indians. Google’s search for new internet users is going hyperlocal!




A ‘MUMBAI FIRST’ 
NBU teams of three or four, comprising members from the US, Sydney, Singapore and India, started at 6:00 am — taking morning walks with locals, shadowing them through the day on buses, local trains and at roadside eateries and keeping awake till midnight. They saw firsthand what makes the Maximum City tick and how technology can solve some of the problems — like locating a 24-hour chemist, a tutor, a coach. Woodward spearheaded the project and visited India at least four times during product development. The result: on May 31, Google launched an app in Mumbai called ‘Neighbourly.’




This announcement went almost unnoticed, overshadowed Patanjali’s Kimbho launch and BJP’s bypolls setback. But for Google, the low-key beta launch is another big step in getting new users online and gaining insights into what those who are already online use mobile internet for. Neighbourly is a ‘Mumbai first’ product from Google and is unique in catering to a single city. In coming weeks and months, the app will be rolled out across more cities. “Getting trustworthy hyperlocal information is tough. We chose Mumbai as it has 20 million people, from all over the world and speaking multiple languages,” said Woodward, in a phone interview from Mumbai. The app works in English, Hindi, Marathi and six other Indian languages.


HYPERLOCAL & NEIGHBOURLY 
The local discovery and community app is a platform to find anything from a doctor, ATM or petrol pump to a mechanic or badminton coach, within 2 km radius. And India is a perfect market — if you develop for India, where less than half the 1.3-billion population is online, you have a product that will work everywhere. In an interview with ET in 2017, Sundar Pichai, chief executive, Google, said, “Over time, you will see more global products that are developed in India first. 




That’s our aspiration.” Neighbourly joined the long list of tweaks and apps by Google for India first; such as offline videos for YouTube, payments platform Tez, two-wheeler navigation on Google Maps, Android Oreo (Go edition) to improve experience on low-RAM phones, Google Assistant for Reliance Jio phones, new apps like Google Go and Files Go, built from scratch and Google WiFi stations in partnership with Indian Railways. “When we build better products for India, we eventually build better products for everyone,” said Caesar Sengupta, vice-president, NBU, at a Google for India event in December 2017.


CLIMBING ON 
Every few minutes, people use a free product or platform from Google, via search, videos, payments or maps. The apps also help collect more data on what people do. The larger vision is to get the next billion users online— many of whom are in India and South East Asia, Africa and Latin America.

India’s diversity makes it an attractive launch pad. Rajan Anandan, vicepresident, South East Asia and India, Google, says, “We have a mission: Internet for every Indian. And to get there, we have to address all barriers — affordability, devices, products, languages and services.”




The Internet can astound and assist new users in equal parts. Madhu Mishra, a female security guard at an office in central Delhi, who recently went online, says, “Internet has added more predictability to my daily routine. I check train timings daily on Google to see whether it’s late and decide whether to take a bus or train back home to Ghaziabad.”

She also bought a ceiling fan, after a price comparison on Google. “Google gave a better idea of what’s available and the price points,” says Madhu, who does voice search in Hindi to look up information. She uses a Spice phone and spends `198 a month on a 3G Idea Cellular connection, which gives her 5 GB data.

Madan Kumar, a watermelon vendor in Delhi, is not yet online but spends `100 a month on an Airtel connection. For Madan, affordability is a challenge that he wants to overcome soon as he feels his earnings will improve if he goes online. Anandan expects at least four billion people worldwide will be online sometime this year, though a significant part of offline people will be in India, a situation Google wants to change.




CVL Srinivas, country manager, WPP India and chief executive, GroupM South Asia, feels, “NBU programme is a great initiative. A lot of divides that exist in India, be it gender, income, education or employment, can be effectively and speedily bridged through digital.”


OF DATA AND SOAP 
For the $108-billion Google, each user going online is a data goldmine even if he or she is earning and spending just a couple of dollars a day.

Vivek Wadhwa, Distinguished Fellow at Harvard Law School, says, “It’s a data game, be it free WiFi, Gmail or anything else.” Google learns more about users and targets them. “Those earning as low as $2 a day, spend that on something, say soap. If Google can give data on what soap 30 million poor people use, it will be a goldmine for companies such as Levers etc,” adds Wadhwa. 




The likes of Levers, Godrej, ITC and Colgate Palmolive will save lot of time-to-market on ground research and instead get that information from Google. The big challenge is that there are 1 billion mobile phone users and less than 400 million of them use the Internet. With its multiple, seemingly unrelated platforms, Google’s goal is common for — track and know what people do. This will translate into ads and revenue for Google. Woodward says, “Monetisation is fairly product-specific. There won’t be one size fits all, but vary from product to product, though my current goal is not monetisation but to solve problems that users face.”


USER IS THE PRODUCT
 For a user, the products and platforms are free, but that’s how the digital ads framework works. “If you are not paying for it, you are the product,” says Advit Sachdev, chief marketing officer, Infibeam. He explains, “For Google, the user is the product and they want more of them so they can market those products and data generated from their daily transactions — be it information search or payment or watching videos.” Once Internet companies such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn et al have user information, programmatic technology — or algorithmic sale and purchase of ads space in real time — steps in. Anything a user does online – visiting a website, the location, ID and past history — is captured and sent to an ad exchange.

On the other side, are advertisers — brands that pay get to show the ads. All this happens in less than 100 milliseconds. So, when Madhu searches for a ceiling fan, Havells, Crompton, Luminous or Usha will compete to show her their ads. To refine the process for advertisers, Google needs to keep collecting data and improve, return on advertising (RoA). Google is also rolling out WiFi in collaboration with Indian Railways and looking at new partnerships as with Pune city.

Sanchit Vir Gogia, founder, Greyhound Research, says, “When you use WiFi, the depth of data collection is better. Also, Google doesn’t have to pay Vodafone or Airtel to buy data if the user is accessing net on free WiFi.” In all, Google is rolling out WiFi at 400 railways stations in India. Raman Kalra, entertainment, media and sports advisory leader, PwC India, says, “At present, about one-third of the digital ads market is going waste due to poor targeting. If you have better data, returns can improve. As the user base scales to 1 billion in India, there are multiple ways to monetise — advertise, cross sell, market data.” For instance, better information could tell whether a customer can afford a Carrier, LG or an O-General air-conditioner.

Even new regulation like Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will help Internet companies. “With GDPR, the quality of data Google and other internet companies have will improve and that will increase trust of users and advertisers on that information, leading to improved monetisation in future,” adds an internet honcho who did not wish to be named. GROWING FORTUNES For Google, India is a small but growing market. Google India crossed the $1 billion sales milestone in fiscal 2017, posting a turnover of Rs 7,208.9 crore (about $1.11 billion), a 22% jump from Rs 5,904 crore in the previous corresponding period. Almost all of this is digital advertising revenue. Google and Facebook corner almost 70% of the digital ad pie in India, growing at 30% a year and expected to be Rs 12,337 crore in 2018, according to GroupM. The overall ad market will be Rs 69,346 crore in 2018, a 13% jump over 2017. The digital ad market is burgeoning but unlike in the past, the competition is catching up with Google. Srinivas says, “With competition growing from over-thetop platforms for videos and from ecommerce players, the digital ecosystem is expanding rapidly beyond one or two players.

This, in turn, is leading to a lot more product innovation from existing players to retain or grow their consumer base.” Google is part of the race. For instance, shoppers on Amazon or people checking out restaurants on Zomato are bypassing Google to search within these apps. To compensate for this loss of users, Google needs to continue adding new ones. “For Google, to increase demand for its platforms, it needs new users. All initiatives are linked to this goal,” says Rakesh Yadav, founder, AdGlobal, a digital advertising platform whose clients include Maruti, Nestle and Coca-Cola.

“Google has the mindshare. To translate that mindshare into marketshare, is the gap it needs to bridge,” says DD Mishra, research director, Gartner India. Google is in no hurry. It wants to keep creating demand for internet and get more users online via new products such as Neighbourly and Tez. As for consumer spends online and monetisation prospects, Anandan says they are tied to per capita incomes. “At around $2,000 per capita, you don’t have much disposable income. At between $2,000 and $4,000 per capita, people will spend on better homes, healthcare and education. Beyond $4,000, it is entirely disposable income.”

Anandan expects that tipping of $4,000 per capita income to happen in about seven years, by 2025. By then, Madhu will probably be searching for an air-conditioner and Madan will run a full-scale fruit mart. And Google will have more data than anyone else on their daily lives, along with that of a billion-plus mobile internet users"
13,2018-06-08,Nestle,"By Saritha Rai

After hastily withdrawing their new messaging app amid glaring security flaws, an Indian billionaire and his penurious yoga guru partner are about to have another go at it.

Acharya Balkrishna, who collaborated with celebrity yogi Baba Ramdev to build an Indian consumer goods empire, plans a formal release of the Kimbho messenger app within weeks as he tries to create a challenger to Facebook Inc’s dominant WhatsApp. But first he has to fix it.

“We pledge not to launch the app until a team of expert hackers and security specialists plug all the security and privacy loopholes,” Balkrishna said in a phone interview as he promised more advanced features than his rival.

The hurried withdrawal of the app, whose name translates as “what’s up” in Sanskrit, a day after its release in May was a rare setback for Balkrishna and Ramdev. The pair built Patanjali Ayurved into a business with $1.6 billion of annual revenue by selling soap, skin cream and instant noodles that embrace the swadeshi, or home-grown, all-natural-and-wholesome creed. Still, in the short time it was available the app racked up 300,000 downloads, the billionaire said.

Ramdev rose to fame in India from appearances on TV, where he demonstrated the cobra, the downward dog and hundreds of other yoga poses. He used his prominence to make Patanjali Ayurved a household name, giving global players such as Nestle SA and Unilever NV a run for their money when it comes to Indian consumer spending. Balkrishna owns most of the stock, while Ramdev holds a minuscule share, in keeping with his adopted life as a ‘sanyasi’ ascetic free of material possessions.

The home-grown character that helped its consumer products succeed is a core proposition behind the messaging app. WhatsApp already dominates India, amassing more than 230 million users and pushing into electronic payments, a rapidly expanding sector in the world’s fastest-growing major economy.

“We respect WhatsApp,” Balkrishna, a user of WhatsApp, said by phone from his base in the ancient city of Haridwar in the foothills of the Himalayas. “But when we have 1.3 billion people, many of them talented software developers, why can’t we build our own messenger with superior features, one that people can trust and which keeps user’s data within India?”

While the initial release proved popular in terms of downloads, the company’s first foray into technology was quickly criticized online by experts as a “joke” and “security disaster.” It was swiftly pulled from stores to be re-tooled.

“The technology could be a work in progress right now, but Patanjali and Baba Ramdev have a strong brand appeal and consumer connection that’ll help drive users to the app,” said Neha Dharia, the Bangalore-based founder and chief executive of technology consultancy Warp Speed Reads Pvt. “Sustainable growth will be their challenge and that’ll depend on the technology they put into the app and the partnerships they drive.”

Kimbho was released on app stores so that a limited number of users could test features such as text messaging, stickers and video calling, said Balkrishna. Fueled by the brand appeal of its high profile backers - Ramdev has more than 10 million followers across social networks - the app proved so popular that Balkrishna said its cloud servers crashed.

“We never dreamed it could catch fire and have 300,000 downloads within hours,” Balkrishna said.

With the upcoming formal release, the initial focus will be on messaging even as WhatsApp prepares to roll out digital payments across the country after an earlier trial run with 1 million users. Despite the competition, India is a massive market and the nation’s internet user base is expected to reach 500 million this summer, most of them doing so via smartphones.

Kimbho adds to an ever expanding array of products from Patanjali, including its own branded SIM cards in partnership with a local carrier. Ramdev has talked of getting into ready-made apparel and recently spoke about building a swadeshi food chain to compete with McDonald’s.

After revenue stagnated in the year ended March amid new taxes and disruptions caused by India’s demonetization, Balkrishna expects the company to resume growth. For the moment, his focus is on getting Kimbho back up.

“People need an alternative,"" he said, predicting it would be used by “all types and levels of Indians.”"
14,2018-06-09,Nestle,"Domestic stocks may have paused to catch their breath, but the weekly reading offers a pretty picture. It turned out to be the third weekly gain.

The upcoming G7 meeting is firmly on investors' radar. Plus, the Trump-Kim summit in Singapore on June 12 is making them play with care. 

What is eating away their confidence, however, is the US slapping tariffs on a wide range of imports from allies like the EU and Canada.

Healthcare counters buzzed big time following a string of USFDA approvals for Indian drugmakers.

For the week gone by, the BSE Sensex rose 0.61 per cent to 35,444 against 35,227.30 on June 1. The NSE Nifty added 0.67 per cent at 10,767.70, from 10,696.20, during the same period.

Here are the stocks and sectors that made news.


Avanti Feeds
Shrimp exporter Avanti Feeds rallied 18 per cent during the week to June 8. The scrip jumped to Rs 1,825.60 on Friday, from Rs 1,543.40 on June 1. 

Managing Director Indra Kumar told ETNow that shrimp demand has normalised and the company has order for the next 6 months. That apparently sparked a turnaround in fortunes. 

“We are not worried about margins and the business is doing pretty good. There is nothing to worry about the business side. Correction in shrimp prices has caused demand to go up,” Kumar held. 


Top gainers 
Himachal Futuristic Communications (up 19.68 per cent), Avanti Feeds (18.29 per cent), Unitech (17.19 per cent), Allahabad Bank (15 per cent) and Caplin Point Labs (11.78 per cent) stole the show. They stood among top gainers in the BSE 500 index this week.


Top losers
Kwality (down 26.32 per cent), JBF Industries (22.48 per cent), Manpasand Beverages (16.42 per cent) and HDIL (12.84 per cent) struggled to catch up and were among top laggards of the week.


Sectoral update
The BSE Healthcare index jumped 3.70 per cent for the week ended Friday. Metal (up 2.58 per cent), oil (2.13 per cent), IT (1.73 per cent) and technology (1.66 per cent) had a good story to tell. On the other hand, power, capital goods, consumer durables and bankex declined between 0.60-1.75 per cent.


Sun shines
Sun Pharmaceuticals had its sunny side up on Friday as the US health regulator did not recommend any action against the company's Halol plant in Gujarat. The scrip closed 8.13 per cent up at Rs 528.20.


@fresh all-time high
As many as nine stocks on the BSE 500 index scaled fresh life-time high during the week gone by. They included HDFC Bank, Nestle India, KPIT Technologies, Varun Beverages, Biocon, JSW Steel, VIP Industries, Gruh Finance and Bajaj Finance.

Sugar stocks waver
Sugar stocks settled the week on a mixed note even as the Cabinet okayed a Rs 8,000 crore bailout package for mills, which is seen to benefit 5 crore sugarcane farmers. 

The government fixed minimum selling price for sugar at Rs 29 per kg. The average ex-mill price of sugar is in the range of Rs 25.60-26.22 per kg. That's below cost of production. 

For the week ended June 8, Bajaj Hindusthan declined 2.71 per cent, followed by Balrampur Chini (down 6.43 per cent) and EID Parry (3.73 per cent). Shree Renuka Sugars settled 0.63 per cent higher at Rs 16.10 for the week."
15,2018-06-10,Nestle,"Timely monsoon will bring demand stability and spur growth this year, while the fast growing e-commerce channel will provide good opportunities in the future, said Nestle India CMD Suresh Narayanan. 

""The monsoon at least this year, seems to be on time. We are an agro-based economy by large, and to that extent, it augurs well...We look forward to stability of demand and hopefully better growth,"" Narayanan told. 

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted an average monsoon this year, which has already hit the Indian coast. 

While, referring to the recent big ticket investments in e-commerce space, he said this channel would improve and grow further in coming years. 

""We welcome the opening of newer channels... Together with the strengthening of backward linkages into the agrarian economy, we should see improvement in the over all pace of business and also the contribution to the business,"" Narayanan said. 

Nestle India, which has crossed Rs 10,000 crore sales in 2017, would continue to pursue its growth here with expansion of product portfolio, he added. 

""Growth would come from existing and new portfolio,"" he said. 

The company, which had suffered setback after a five-month ban on its popular instant noodles Maggi in 2015, has introduced several new products in food and chocolates and confectioneries categories. It has also pulled back some of them after evaluation. 

""It's an ongoing programme, we are consistently trying to evaluate our products and I am happy to say about a fifth of our growth is coming from new products,"" he added. 

On upcoming products, he said that Nestle has already announced the launch of breakfast cereals, which would be a significant move. 

""Now we have secular growth across categories and that is something we would like to continue,"" he added. 

Maggi now has around 60 per cent market share of the instant noodles segment. 

""We are at little over 60 per cent of the market share and I think we have got a healthy traction of the business. New innovations have seen good responses and I am happy with the progress which has been made with so far,"" Narayanan added. 

Maggi commanded a market share of around 75 per cent prior to the five-month ban in 2015. 

On being asked whether Nestle would be able to cross that figure in the future, he said, ambition is always there and we are trying to get as close as possible to where we were."""

20,2018-06-14,Nestle,"NEW DELHI: After shaking up the FMCG market, Patanjali Ayurved has firmed up plans to take apparels market by storm. The company is set to launch its clothing brand ‘Paridhan’ by the end of this year, Patanjali MD and co-founder Acharya Balkrishan said in a TV interview. Apparels would be manufactured in-house via a third party, he said. 

Balkrishna said a team had been formed in Noida to handle the company's apparel business. Patanjali would open 100 exclusive stores in metros as well as non-metros, he said.

Patanjali founder yoga guru Baba Ramdev had earlier said that the textile portfolio would have around 3,000 products including kidswear, yoga wear, sportswear, caps, shoes, towels, bedsheets and accessories.

However, the most-awaited item would be its swadeshi jeans, which the company says it has adapted to Indian conditions.

“Jeans is a western concept and there are two things we can do with western concepts.Either boycott them or adopt them but customise them to suit our traditions. Jeans have become so popular that they cannot be taken away from the Indian society. Swadeshi jeans will be Indianised jeans in style, design and fabric,” Balakrishna told ET two years ago when Patanjali swadeshi jeans was still a concept.

“Our jeans for women will be loose so that they comply with Indian cultural norms and are also comfortable for them. Indian families will find our swadeshi jeans concept very comfortable,” he said.

“Denim jeans that people wear these days come from abroad or are manufactured here by western companies. They are all based on designs and cultural patterns of foreign countries. These are not suited to Indian culture. Our jeans will be similar to many Indian clothes. This will make Indian women feel comfortable too,” he said.

After giving sleepless nights to FMCG giants such as Hindustan Unilever, Nestle and Colgate, Patanjali will now lock horns with big apparel brands such as Levis and Wrangler, if its modified jeans catch on with the youth."

27,2018-06-28,Nestle,"KOLKATA: Aashirvaad atta, Sunfeast cookies, and Bingo snacks are helping cement ITC’s credentials on the Indian packaged foods leaderboard, helping the segment log about half the annual sales of the conglomerate’s traditional mainstay — cigarettes.

At the tobacco products-FMCG-hotels major, which just published its annual report, the branded packaged food business made up 22.1% of the net turnover in FY18, compared with the 46% contribution from cigarettes, which also had a far higher base. Agri-business was the third largest — about half of packaged foods — in net sales contributions. ITC’s net revenue in FY18 was Rs 39,255 crore.

The packaged foods business was the first FMCG category the conglomerate had entered 17 years ago to reduce its reliance on the cigarette revenue stream. It clocked sales of Rs 8,668.7 crore in FY18, ITC reported in the annual report.

In FY17, packaged food sales were at Rs 8,036.4 crore, but the revenues are not comparable due to the transition to the GST regime, in which sales are calculated net of GST. Earlier calculations included the impact of the excise levy.

The company’s packaged foods division now accounts for 76% of the total sales of non-cigarette FMCG business, which also includes personal care, stationary products, lifestyle retail, safety matches and incense sticks.

The non-cigarette FMCG business also clocked gross profit of Rs 164.1 crore in FY18, driven by the food business, with other categories yet to break even. ITC continues to be the third largest listed packaged foods company in India: Nestle (Rs 9,472.5 crore domestic sales in CY17) leads the table, followed by cookies maker Britannia (standalone sales of Rs 9,380.2 crore in FY18). ITC has ambitions to establish itself as India’s biggest packaged foods company.

In foods, ITC is the market leader in packaged atta, premium cream biscuits, and the bridges segment in snacks. It is the second largest in instant noodles and the third in packaged juice.

By way of consumer spend that includes taxes, Aashirvaad is the largest non-cigarette food brand at more than Rs 4,000 crore, followed by Sunfeast at more than Rs 3,500 crore, and Bingo at more than Rs 2,000 crore. In FY18, ITC had entered into packaged fruits and vegetables, blended spices and frozen prawns, and is betting on the dairy business as the next big growth driver."
0,2018-07-05,Nestle,"NEW DELHI: Losses in energy, IT, pharma, consumer durables, metal and teck stocks, in the backdrop of negative Asian cues and depreciating Indian currency made the market to snap its two-day winning streak on Thursday.

Market barometer Sensex remained listless through the day, barring intermittent small gains, as investors looked for direction while the imminent imposition of US tariffs on China kept them on tenterhooks.

The unabated slide of the Indian rupee against the US dollar further dampened the sentiment. At the time of writing this report, the rupee was trading down by 23 paise.

Crude oil prices, however, eased after the US President Donald Trump asked Opec to cut prices. 

“Market traded in a narrow range while the selling pressure in IT and metal stocks capped the upside. Any signs of stability in bond yields and oil price may provide some turnaround in the domestic sentiment. On the other hand, mid and small cap continued to underperform as investors are switching to large caps to minimize the risk. Global market stays in a positive terrain but Asian market witnessed consolidation due to trade restrictions and weakening currency,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.

The NSE Nifty50 shed 20 points, or 0.19 per cent, to settle at 10,750, with 26 stocks advancing and 24 declining.

1,2018-07-11,Nestle,"PepsiCo, grappling with a slumping soda business, got another boost from its food operations. The maker of Mountain Dew drink posted second quarter profit that topped analysts’ estimates, helped by strong sales of Frito-Lay chips and Quaker oatmeal, according to a statement on Tuesday.

Core earnings per share were $1.61, 9 cents above analysts’ consensus estimate. Results sent company shares up 1.6% in early trade. Stock closed Monday at $107.76 in New York, down 10% for the year. PepsiCo, like rival Coca-Cola, is looking beyond sugary soda to drive growth as consumers become more health-conscious. Chief executive officer Indra Nooyi has said fixing the struggling North American beverage unit is a top priority, but in the meantime the company is getting a boost from its food brands.

Consumer giants ranging from PepsiCo to Nestle are wrestling with changing tastes as shoppers turn away from sugary foods and drinks and seek out healthier fare. Consumption of carbonated soft drinks fell to a 32-year low in the US last year, according to Beverage-Digest, a trade publication.

While chips have been less affected than sodas, PepsiCo has also introduced organic versions of some big snack brands, in addition to buying startup competitors."
2,2018-07-12,Nestle,"Midcaps stocks like Nagarjuna Construction or a SAIL or a CESC will see a lot of traction after the earnings are out, Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive Vice President, Markets, IIFL, tells ET Now. Edited excerpts: 


A true dichotomy is playing out in the market. Midcaps continue to suffer while we are rejoicing and celebrating 11,000 on the Nifty. Do you think this phenomenon is going to continue wherein broader markets suffer and benchmarks hold up?
I have not seen any celebration. I only see pessimism and that is typically Indian behaviour. We have been an outperforming index globally and despite all walls of worry, Nifty is at 11,000. Rather than appreciate that, we are talking of underperformance. All you have to have is patience. The stock market is not going to be rekindling everything in a jiffy but this evidence of underperformance may soon be coming to end.

If you do get another 5% fall in crude in next seven days, ten days or a month, then you will see a huge amount of pent up buying coming in the midcaps. There is a lot of value accretion in the midcaps and today you may have seen a perfect day of foreigners buying and maybe the local mutual funds booking profit. 

But inherently, do not miss the woods for the trees. We are headed much higher and last six months every fund manager was talking about the outperformance of China and the underperformance of India. Well it is a total reverse. Indian stocks are going to be the best and most sought after and we have just had two $100 billion companies! In the next few years, we should be creating much more. I am extremely bullish over a slightly longer period of time and in the next 60 days, midcaps should do extremely well if the Nifty maintains above this 11,000 to 11,300.


What is your take on defensive sectors like IT, FMCG, where we have not seen any meaningful correction and stocks have been moving up. Do you have any top picks in the FMCG space?
One of my top picks in the FMCG space was Nestle which was at Rs 6,700, then Rs 7,000, then Rs 7,200 and it has been making new highs ever since. Nestle and Lever will be the biggest beneficiaries after GST and the destocking and that will be evident in the numbers. The stocks are not cheap but they will keep getting more expensive. 

So, forget the top 10-20 stocks. Those will be too much in demand. That is how your extra beta is made but look at the broader market. That is where the real value lies. Look at it if you move from FMCG into consumer durables. Voltas and Havell’s in both their spaces are looking extremely good and the underlying businesses are improving. 

In FMCG, the management commentary from Marico sounded extremely bullish over the next six to nine months. In this quarter, there may have been a little bit of pressure on margins. Look for a Marico, Emami, Bata or a Page Industry, but these are not to be available at any discount. They will always be at a premium. The real discount is where you can be discerningly patient because the market will give you returns but it is just a matter of time.


Which are the segments that you are going to be watching out very closely in this earnings season. TCS and IndusInd Bank have set the ball rolling in IT and private banking space. Where else will your focus lie?
IT, FMCG and consumption. Some of the NBFCs could be relative outperformers. I also think that larger banks like State Bank and Bank of Baroda could see some write backs which could add to the bottom line even though there would be pressure on treasury income.

As I have been telling you, there would be an open offer for IDBI. I can reiterate the last tranche of government recapitalisation was done at Rs 72.50. You will get a price of at least Rs 75 on IDBI and that would mean that the floating 6-7% could actually get a huge upside over a period of time. Midcaps stocks like Nagarjuna Construction or a SAIL or a CESC will see a lot of traction. The broader market outperformance on results would be the key for rerating of some of the midcaps."
3,2018-07-15,Nestle,"NEW DELHI: FMCG major Hindustan Unilever is poised to report its financial results on Monday for the quarter ended June 2018 on Monday. There are expectations that consumer-oriented companies are likely to see double-digit volume growth aided by a recovery in rural areas and a soft base.

An assessment by Kotak Institutional Equities showed that the company may report 27.80 per cent year-on-year (YoY) rise in net profit at Rs 1,639.70 crore in Q1FY19, while net sales may increase by 14.70 per cent on year-on-year basis.

The brokerage house sees 25.80 per cent YoY and 26.90 per cent YoY jump in EBITDA and EPS, respectively, for the quarter ended June 2018. 

“We expect the FMCG bellwether to report another solid quarter with 20 per cent comparable topline growth driven by 14 per cent underlying volume growth (UVG),” Kotak said in a report. 

Edelweiss Securities projected 13.80 per cent YoY and 11.50 per cent YoY growth in net profit and revenue, respectively. EBITDA may jump 16.20 per cent YoY.

""We expect HUL, Dabur, Britannia, Marico, Asian Paints, Berger Paints, Pidilite, Emami (on a very soft base), and Nestle to report double-digit volume growth,"" Edelweiss Securities said.

The brokerage house expects HUL to report a volume growth of around 11-12 per cent YoY on a flat base. The growth is likely to be stronger on the back of improving sentiment and preference towards HUL products such as Lever Ayush as well as decent performance of new launches. 

HUL may also report higher ad spends too to back their new launches."
4,2018-07-17,Nestle,"Stock picking turned difficult this year thanks to strong volatility in the domestic equity market. Market participants look undecided whether to go with a technical or fundamental view.

But how about going with the combination of the two? CAN SLIM does exactly that to identify potential value stocks. 

Developed by investor William O’Neil, this is a techno-fundamental strategy that helps pick quality stocks. Fundamentals give the conviction to hold a stock while technicals indicate attractive entry and exit points.

 “CAN SLIM is a rules-based investment system based on the study of historical multibagger price runs in stocks. The system was created by one of America’s most successful stock investors, William O’Neil, after he studied stock market winners and market cycles going back to the 19th century,” says Anupam Singhi, CEO, William O’Neil India.

William O’Neil observed that most multibaggers shared seven common characteristics. He then started investing in stocks that had developed there seven traits and went on to become one of the all-time investing legends.

“The methodology is based on 100 per cent realistic historical studies of how the stock market has actually worked,” Singhi said.

Since its inception four years ago, the MarketSmith India model portfolio based on CAN SLIM has grown around 111 per cent between June 1, 2014 and July 6, 2018. The Nifty has gained over 40 per cent during the same period. 

“CAN SLIM is primarily a momentum trading or investing strategy. It tends to work well in a directional market. Like any other strategy, it too has its pros and cons. CAN SLIM may not do very well in a choppy market. As a strategy, it tries to merge fundamentals and technical analysis,” says Kolkata-based value investor Abhishek Basumallick.


How does CANSLIM work?
CAN SLIM is a guideline where each letter stands for an important factor that needs to be considered before investing in a stock.


C – Current Earnings
Healthy financial performance in most recent quarters demonstrates that a business is able to succeed in the current environment.


A – Annual Earnings
A history of healthy sales and earnings growth in recent years demonstrates that a business model is sustainable and viable, and can generate profits consistently.


N – New Product/Service, Management or Price High
Studies have shown that the greatest stock market winners of the past were all trying something new. Always look for companies with new, game-changing products and services


S – Supply and Demand
S is for supply and demand of the stock. As more investors demand a limited supply of shares, a stock’s price goes up. Look for heavy volume accumulation by institutional investors, particularly at key moments like when the stock is breaking above prior resistance levels.


L – Leader or Laggard
True leaders are those companies that show best earnings growth, strongest sales, superior price performance, and are in leading industry groups. Every bull market has a new leader and there is no point getting stuck with stocks that belong to the lagging industry groups. Look for the best of the best – leaders in strong industries that are showing superior earnings growth and sales.


I – Institutional Sponsorship
Mutual funds, banks and other professional investors are big players who drive the market. For a stock to be a top performer, it must have institutional support to fuel its price moves. Look for stocks that are showing signs of heavy accumulation and consistent increase in the number of funds holding the stock.


M – Market Direction
Studies have shown that three out of every four stocks follow the current market trend. You should always trade in sync with the market. You should be buying more stocks when the market is in an uptrend, and protecting your capital when the market is in a downtrend.

“This rules-based system helps identify stocks with the right fundamental profile to succeed. Once the stock passes this litmus test, one needs to look out for a breakout from a sound base pattern. Base patterns are periods of sideways movement where the stock has less buying interest. No stock can be in a rally forever, even multibaggers have periods of consolidation and we must wait for the stocks to breakout to new highs before we take any fresh position. A rules-based system helps us nail down fundamentally strong growth stocks, and then we wait for the technical buy signal, i.e. the breakout, to pick up the stock,” said Singhi of William O'Neil India.


Who can go with the strategy?
To be successful in the stock market, all investors regardless of whether they are first-timers or experienced investing professionals need to learn sound, historically proven buy rules as well as sell rules.

Singhi says CAN SLIM strategy is tailored for investors looking to beat the market by investing in stocks with high quality fundamentals. The aim of the system is to capture big price runs by buying fundamentally strong stocks that are market leaders. 

“Our strategy gives investors a huge advantage by materially improving stock selection and timing. The system requires strict discipline and helps investors develop the right money management skills,” he added.


Top stocks on the basis of CAN SLIM model
William O'Neil India shared a list of 10 stocks based on the CAN SLIM model with ETMarkets.com.


Asian Paints: Organised paint companies are likely to get benefitted from increasing population and housing shortages in India, which will drive growth for residential construction industry (expected to grow at 15 per cent during the period 2018-2022). Moreover, the government’s push for affordable housing under its plan “Housing for all by 2022” is providing much needed traction for the paint industry. 


Nestle India: The revival of its major brand Maggi (60 per cent market share) and new product launches (40 new products over the past two years across various segments) helping the company to substantiate its position in the market. Moreover, the reducing material cost helping Nestle in expanding its margin. The deflationary price trend in Q1 2018 (-11 per cent YoY) for skimmed milk powder continues to prevail owing to an excess supply leading to a decline in prices by Rs 4-10 per litre. Coffee prices also continue to decline 4 per cent YoY as of H1 2018, reaching the low recorded in 2014. “With the lowering input prices, we expect its margins to further expand in 2018, supported by a favourable product mix and input costs,” said Singhi.


Maruti Suzuki: Maruti Suzuki is the largest passenger vehicle company in India by sales. The management is confident about its future prospects and expects to sell 2 million vehicles by FY2020. 


VIP Industries: The company manufactures a wide range of hard-sided and soft-sided luggage under the VIP, Skybags, Alfa, Aristocrat, Carlton, and Caprese brands. The company reported five consecutive quarters of high double-digit EPS growth. It is expected to grow further on the back of its capacity expansions in Bangladesh, where it currently enjoys a tax holiday of seven years. Moreover, aggressive brand promotion, growth in the aviation industry, and wider retail network add more revenue prospects for the Company.


Britannia Industries: This company drives its growth through its capacity expansion plan, new product introductions, and geographic expansion. In addition, the goods and services tax has brought the unorganised sector (25 per cent of biscuit market) under the tax net, helping the company gain 170bps of market share in the Hindi-speaking belt, where it faces intense competition from regional players. It reported three consecutive quarters of double-digit earnings growth and two consecutive quarters of double-digit revenue growth.

Edelweiss Financial Services: Edelweiss has delivered industry leading growth with its credit book growing to Rs 42,010 crore in FY 2018 from Rs 3,956 crore in FY 2012, implying a CAGR of 48.3 per cent. The company achieved this growth while maintaining healthy net interest margins (7.7 per cent in FY 2018) and robust asset quality with net NPA at 0.7 per cent, at the end of FY 2018.


KEI Industries: This is a cable manufacturing company involved in the manufacturing and supply of power cables and other industrial cables. KEI Industries’ strong order book and the growing pace of export are helping it substantiate its position. It aims to boost its B2C business and increase its distribution channel to 1,500 by FY 2019 from 926 dealers in FY 2016. Moreover, it also increased its advertising budget to reach to a wider audience. These measures should help the company increase its retail sales in the long run.


Quess Corp: Quess is India’s leading integrated business service provider with a pan-India presence, headquartered in Bengaluru. It has 65 offices across India in 34 cities along with overseas footprints in North America, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. The stock posted double-digit sales and EPS growth over the last three years. Quess Corp is also tapping into the smart city project in Ahmedabad by entering into a joint venture with Trimax IT Infrastructure and Service. As a part of the project, it aims to create digital, communication, and information infrastructure.


Tata Elxsi: It is one of the leading providers of technology and designing services for product engineering solutions to the automotive, broadcast and communication, and health care industries. The company largely thrives on R&D spends by global companies. Moreover, it is expected to largely benefit from the government’s target of selling 70 lakh electric and hybrid vehicles by 2020.


HDFC Bank: It is the second-largest private lender by assets with a focus on rural and semi-urban markets. Its asset quality remains top-notch thanks to stringent credit origination practices, strong monitoring system, and adequate provisioning.

Along with increased digitisation, the bank is also expanding its presence in rural and semi-urban areas, which are largely underpenetrated. Among the total number of branches, 53 per cent of the total bank outlets are in semi-urban and rural locations. The expansion strengthens its retail segment, which is highly dependent on SME and unsecured lending. The share of unsecured lending and SME continues to trend higher; recorded at 47.6 per cent in FY 2018 compared with 40.8 per cent in FY 2015. Double-digit sales and earnings growth coupled with strong ROE continue to attract the investor community, according to William O’Neil India."

10,2018-07-18,Nestle,"One mega theme to emerge will be to have asset managers and life insurers in the portfolio. The second mega theme will be staffing as a space and formalisation as a theme, Saurabh Mukherjea, Independent Market Expert, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts: 
You have been bearish and you have been right. You were calling for this sharp correction in midcap and smallcap stocks. It was a very isolated call and you were the only caller of this bubble in the midcap space. Are you still bearish or do you think it is time to put money to work now?
The market cap migration from smallcap and midcap to largecaps will continue.


It is actually mega caps, if you think about it..
Yes. Liquidity is getting tighter. If you see the RBI LAF window, for the first time in five years, we are going to stay where the banks will start borrowing from the RBI. Deposit growth is weak for the banks. The banks will soon have to start borrowing from the RBI and that will be the first time since this bull market started in say autumn of 2013 that the banks will start borrowing from RBI. This is a good indicator that liquidity is tightening in the system. 

If liquidity tightens cost of money goes up, and smallcap and midcaps will have a tougher time. A migration to FMCG and auto stocks will benefit from rural plays. Migration to IT and pharma, which obviously have a currency linked element to it, also makes sense. It has already started in the last six-seven months. This will continue through the next three-four months as well.


12 months ago, the general view was that economy was on the mend, cyclicals will make a comeback, industrial demand will open up, capacity utilisation will pick up. But the data points what we are looking at are telling us that the corporate demand is not making a comeback despite government spending on bijli pani road (electricity, water and roads). On the flip side, demand has picked up in urban, semi-urban and rural areas. Did the market misread where the demand would come from?
What has happened is consumption has recovered. Basically, the disruptive effects of DeMonetisation and GST have worn off. Over the last six-seven months, clearly consumption has recovered. Rural has recovered even more than urban because rural suffered more than urban. Now unless we can fix this banking system, it is difficult to get a capex cycle going. 

We are largely a country where capex is funded through the banking system rather than the bond market. We do not really have a long-term bond market. Pending meaningful recapitalisation of the banking system, perhaps changed the ownership of public sector banks which I cannot see happening this side of the general elections.

A meaningful capex recovery will be hard to spot. What is encouraging though is the first sign that the job creation cycle seems to have begun -- in terms of construction jobs, a few signs of capex in the FMCG and auto sector. But overall, the capex cycle will have to wait for the general election and for the banking sector to be repaired.


I completely agree with your point when you say stick with consumption, FMCG, auto. But how much more of Nestle or Britannia would you buy? These are the most expensive stocks. Nestle is now trading at 56 times, Unilever at 58 times, Britannia 60 times. Nestle has already crossed that Rs 1 lakh crore market cap. It’s the same in Maruti.
Obviously in some pockets of FMCG, the valuations are high. If you look back to November-December, I was shouting myself hoarse saying that IT stocks were undervalued. IT has had a very smart recovery and it will hold itself together quite nicely as the currency stays weak and America recovers. 

Similarly, in pharma there will be a recovery if the rupee continues to stay a weak 69-70 to the dollar. Pharma stocks were pulverised last year and there is an upside story in pharma which the market is ignoring currently.

Coming back to the rural story, we can look at tractor stocks. We have got M&M. In the FMCG context, there is ITC. There are pockets in auto and FMCG as well where there is value to be had. Not all FMCG and auto stocks are sensibly priced but there are pockets of value in FMCG and auto as well and more generally in pharma and IT.


The only problem with pharma is you do not know which way USFDA is going right now. Just yesterday, there was that injunction on DRL and again the stock tanked. Pharma continues to be a little bit of a grey zone.
The day-to-day action in IT, pharma, the regulatory cycles in these sectors, what President Trump does, will have a bearing. All we can do as stock pickers is to say look for companies in these sectors with great long-term capital allocation track records.


Like? Take the case of the pharma sector. If you look at Lupin’s long-term capital allocation track record, it is very difficult to find fault with that. We obviously know the company has been through a set of challenges from the last…


Even the Gavis has backfired.
There has been a set of challenges but if you step back and say I will take the Coffee Can Portfolio, look for companies which have allocated capital sensibly over 10-20 years. I will buy them and run with them. Back in November-December, when I was saying IT is significantly undervalued, a lot of people were saying TCS is a stock with barely any growth. Why would you buy it? Look at what has happened to TCS in the last six-seven months. 

Just look at companies with great track records, buy them at sensible valuations and not crazy valuations of 50-60 times. Buy them at high teens, low 20s and then just run with them because overall that will give you strong compounding in the portfolio. 

The Coffee Can Portfolio constructs still works. All you are trying to do is keep some cognisance of valuations which are becoming a little crazy in spots of the market.


Not in IT.
Not in IT, but the sector which worries me the most is banking and NBFCs which have got both several stocks which are at north of four times price to book and in many of these cases these lenders are borrowing heavily from the wholesale market -- the CP or the CD market and they are lending to private sector borrowers.


What is your concern there? Is your concern that now things are looking good and so they are riding the wave and asset quality is not a concern but if rates continue to go up, then that will like affect them?
Yes. The 10-year bond yield goes up from 6.5% a year ago to close to 8% now. In the short-term money market, cost of money market borrowing is up 130-140 bps. My reckoning is liquidity will continue to get tighter -- whether it is banks struggling to get deposits or whether it is the Government of India’s bond yields going up. 

Liquidity is going to get tighter and as cost of money goes up. All of these lenders whether they are private sector banks or NBFCs, who are borrowing in the wholesale market, will have to increase their lending rates and that will be a double whammy which slows down the loan book growth and it increases the NPA numbers and the valuation on these stocks.


But private banks have a more balanced business model. My concern is with the NBFCs. Do you think there is a bubble building there?
Within NBFCs, let us draw a distinction between housing finance companies where this risk is particularly high. They are borrowing in the short-term market. They are borrowing 6-month, 12-month money and they are giving out 20-year loans. You are taking a massive asset liability mismatch. The risk is a little less with say truck financiers because they are doing three-year, five-year loans. 

But even in private sector banks, while some of them have great CASA franchises, some of the private sector banks do not really have very powerful CASA franchises. They are heavily dependent on wholesale market, something like 70-80% of their borrowing for some of the private sector banks is coming from the CD market. They have a banking license but that does not necessary mean that all of them have built CASA franchises. Some of them have but some of them have not.


Which ones are you hinting at?
If I look at the better CASA franchises, then obviously an HDFC Bank or a Kotak Bank could count amongst them. But beyond the top three or four names, the other private sector banks do not have powerful CASA franchises and the cost of money is a huge driver of the stock market and of banks and NBFCs. Nearly 40% of the market cap of our market now is these stocks.


Yes, it amazes me. I was looking at DCB Bank and the CASA is not even 30%. The liability in the market is getting less because there is AU Finance, there is Ujjivan. Everybody wants the share of liability and it is not easy to get that liability.
And it is an election year. State and central governments will borrow heavily from the bond market -- whether it is to fund these farm loan waivers or to fund the MSP hikes they have announced two weeks ago. As the government crowds out money from the bond market, the pool goes down and deposit growth is not very high.


The data as of now is indicating that we have seen a massive bull run in NBFCs. In Bajaj Finance, a lakh of rupees in 10 years has become a crore. In Gruh Finance, a lakh of rupee in 2008 or 2009 has gone up 60-70x. Do you think in the next big sector or cycle which could be called a secular cycle for next 5-10 years, this sector will have a natural tailwind? All you need to do is just align your portfolio with two-three large players and hit a home run? 
I have discussed a couple of mega themes before. The first was around savings. For the last three years, for the first time in this country’s history, we have saved more through financial savings than through physical savings and real estate and gold. We are doing roughly $200-250 billion per annum of financial savings. 

In the next 10 years, that number will hit a trillion dollar per year of financial savings. There is enormous room for plays which are linked to asset management, life insurance, wealth management and good quality broking. There are not too many listed plays in that. There will be more asset management and life insurance companies listed in the years to come, but that will be a structural theme. It will work wonderfully well over the next decade.


Flip your HDFC Bank with a top insurer name. Flip your NBFC may be with an asset management company?
I am not so sure you should flip your HDFC Bank but if you have a lesser bank in your portfolio, then certain consider exposure to high quality insurer or a high quality asset manager. 


Lesser bank will be non-index bank?
 A lesser bank in the sense a bank which does not have a great track record of lending money or of CASA. 


I can think of only two…
Right. We will discuss those names on another show perhaps later on but for high quality Indian portfolio, to have asset managers and life insurers will become a must. So, that is one mega theme. We have to think about it very actively. The structural thrust is towards financial savings, leaving aside the financial economy in the real world and the formalisation of the country. While we have discussed various building materials plays, the staffing companies will be a natural play on formalisation because you are taking a labour force which is primarily informal. 

They will start coming into the formal world. The staffing companies are a kind of go between. They are the brokers of people. Staffing as a space and formalisation as a theme would be another mega theme that will work wonderfully well.


What about the good old India romance – consumption? It may not be exactly soaps, shampoo or the typical HULs of the world but if we are saving more, we are consuming more. Instead of buying five pieces of apparel a year, millennials would say buy 15; instead of watching one movie in a month, they would watch five. There are lot of these trends at play.
Absolutely. None of us are denying that the good quality consumption plays will continue to have a…


Despite have a good life, all I am saying…
 …one thing to worth remembering is when you consume heavily as a country and your capex cycle is not particularly strong, you naturally end up with a big current account deficit. A current account deficit is big and I think it is potentially going to get bigger in the next 12 months…


That is what America is doing.
That naturally means a weakening currency and if the currency is going to weaken further, and I believes the rupee is overdue for a further bout of weakening, then sectors which are linked to a weak currency -- IT and pharma -- naturally come back into the reckoning.


Is the distress in broader market anywhere close to over or would this huge dichotomy continue for a while?
I believe that at 36,000-37,000, the Sensex is overvalued by a good 15%. The market is overvalued. Smallcaps and midcaps were egregiously overvalued. The market is overvalued but within the largecap space, BFSI specifically stands out like a sore thumb. The BFSI fate is linked to the liquidity cycle. The data from RBI suggests meaningful tightening in the liquidity cycle over the last six months. 

There is a very strong correlation between bull markets in India and the RBI’s LAF window being open in terms of banks’ lending money to RBI rather than borrowing. As soon as banks start borrowing money from the RBI, that is a clear sign that liquidity has tightened and in the next two-three months, you are going to get into that.


Are you calling a correction even in the largecaps from these levels?
The market is overvalued. Smallcaps and midcaps were egregiously overvalued, almost bubble like.


You are talking about shifting money into largecaps. Is it time to really buy more index funds or largecap oriented instruments versus midcaps?
There is double consideration that one should do. Rotating from smallcaps and midcaps to largecaps makes a lot of sense. Within largecaps, being underweight on financials makes sense and overall thinking long term over three-five year horizons rather than trying to make money from the market over a 12-month horizon makes sense."

11,2018-07-22,Nestle,"E-commerce companies such as Amazon and Myntra are likely to face an audit by tax authorities to check if they have passed on cuts in goods and services tax (GST) rates to consumers.

The National Anti-Profiteering Authority has directed the director general, audit, to conduct the examination.

The GST Council had slashed tax rates on a host of household products such as chocolates, toothpaste, shampoo, washing powder and shaving creams to 18 per cent from 28 per cent in November last year. More products were shifted to a lower slab or fully exempted at the GST Council’s latest meeting.

Tax authorities have kept a close watch on companies to ensure that rate cuts were being passed on to consumers, with several of them paying excess amounts collected to the government for the consumer welfare fund. They include Nestle and Hindustan Unilever.

Others that got notices were Jubilant FoodWorks (Domino’s Pizza), Hardcastle Restaurants (McDonald’s), retailer Lifestyle International and auto firm Honda Motor, EThas reported previously.

The government carried out a campaign to educate consumers about the tax cuts and what they could do if they found shopkeepers were not complying.



Tax experts say it’s important for ecommerce companies to look at the aspect of refunding excess tax to consumers.

“The objective is to check if excess amount collected before rate reduction has indeed been refunded to buyers or not,” said Anita Rastogi, indirect tax partner, PwC. “Hence, it becomes critical for e platforms to examine this aspect and refund the amount ( if required) as soon as possible.”

Incidentally, the anti-profiteering GST watchdog recently gave relief to Flipkart in a significant ruling on a complaint dealing with voluntary discounts offered by sellers on the platform.

The discount, the authority said, was offered out of the supplier's profit and GST was charged at the appropriate rate and there was no case of antiprofiteering."
12,2018-07-25,Nestle,"NEW DELHI: The nationwide truckers’ strike that entered its fifth day on Tuesday has begun impacting supplies of essential products, household items and mobile phones. In some instances, factories have been forced to shut or run slow owing to lack of raw material supplies, raising serious concerns among large firms that retailers could start running out of stocks if the strike persists.

Deliveries from ecommerce marketplaces are also being delayed, while billing processes have been disrupted, company executives said. Amazon has sent text messages to buyers stating that “it is doing its best to get delayed packages delivered at the earliest”. Besides impacting movement of manufactured products, restricted supplies of vegetables, fruit and dairy products have been driving up prices.

The strike could have a detrimental impact on the movement of all categories of consumer goods, said Vinay Singh Kushwaha, Britannia’s vicepresident, supply chain.

“We had fore-planned our operations and hence taken mitigatory actions to minimise impact,” he said.

“Our stock movements are going on relatively as per plan. However, there are disruptions in certain locations which we are expecting to subside in the next day or so. If it doesn’t, it could be detrimental to movement of all categories of consumer goods,” he said.

The strike comes at a time when the consumer goods industry has forecast a healthy quarter riding on a good monsoon, price rationalisation following goods and services tax (GST) cuts and improved consumer sentiment.




“Supplies of finished products from consumer goods firms are being impacted over the past couple of days,” said Vipul Mittal, head, fruit and vegetables, at online grocery retailer BigBasket. “We are hoping the situation is resolved soon and supplies of fruit and vegetables also are not disrupted.”

Supplies from firms such as Reckitt Benckiser, Nestle and Dabur too are beginning to be impacted at plants while others such as biscuit maker Pladis have halted production starting Tuesday.

“We are severely impacted by this transport strike. We are unable to move our products and our production has also suffered because of the impact on raw material supplies,” said Abhishek Sharma, president of Pladis India, maker of McVitie’s biscuits.

“If it continues any further, we will not be able to deliver this month's business forecasts.”

Some estimates peg losses at Rs 10,000 crore. The strike is being supported by local trade unions nationwide and the impact is across sectors.

“We were expecting a good quarter since all the macros have been indicating consumption on the rise,” said the chief executive of a leading packaged foods maker, which supplies to Hindustan Unilever among others. “However, the truckers’ strike, if not resolved, could well lead to a shortfall of supplies of daily-use products on shop shelves.”

The strike has been called by the All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC) in protest against rising fuel prices and a “flawed and non-transparent” toll system.

Truckers have also demanded a reduction in central and state-levied taxes by bringing diesel under GST.

“We are not able to bill products and supply at certain locations to distribution partners for the past two-three days,” said consumer electronics and phone maker Panasonic's mobility head Pankaj Rana. “Connecting factory locations (or hub warehouses) is the major issue.”

Tarun Pathak, associate director at Counterpoint Research, said that moving locally sourced components such as chargers and data cables would be a challenge, given that most handset companies have their assembly or manufacturing in the northern and southern ends of the country.

“The strike will impact intercity movement, and if it continues beyond 10 days, then it will start to impact sales,” he said. “Mobile handset companies typically plan keeping such issues in mind."" Truck owners went on an indefinite strike from July 20 after negotiations between the AIMTC and the government collapsed.

“Yes, there is a huge impact on our secondary movements of goods from our Delhi warehouse to state warehouses, and further from state warehouse to distributor points,” said Sanjay Kalirona, chief executive of mobile phone maker Comio India. “A few states like Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Maharashtra, Rajasthan have felt a major impact where movement is completely on hold.”"

16,2018-07-29,Nestle,"Alarmed by the rise of lifestyle diseases, the FSSAI has launched the ‘Eat Right Movement’, and food companies around the country have pledged their support.

In November 2017, top officials at the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) sat up when they flipped through the pages of the India State-level Disease Burden Trends report. While life expectancy had gone up, more Indians were dying of non-communicable diseases such as ischemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), stroke, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease, the report stated. ‘Risks, which include diets low in fruit, vegetables, and whole grains, but high in salt and fat, were India’s third leading risk factor for health loss in 2016’.

According to FSSAI, one in four Indians is at risk of dying from one of the Non-Communicable Diseases, such diabetes, blood pressure, heart disease or cancer. And diabetes has become India’s fastest growing disease since 2000, according to a study released in 2017 by two research institutes – The Indian Council for Medical Research and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation – and advocacy group Public Health Foundation of India. The same year, the International Diabetes Federation claimed there were over 72 million cases of diabetes in India, a number which, some experts say, will almost double by 2025, if current dietary trends continue. These numbers forced the food safety regulator to not just accelerate its ongoing draft regulation on labelling packaged foods with high fat, sugar and salt (HFSS) content with red dots, but put their best minds together to draw up a larger plan.

On July 10, the Eat Right Movement was launched to usher in a ‘new food culture’ by nudging businesses and consumers to cut down on salt, sugar and trans-fat in their food. In a video on the campaign’s website, actor Rajkummar Rao, the pro bono ambassador for the ‘movement’, as the stakeholders like to call it, recites the campaign’s tagline – ‘Aaj se thoda kam.’ The idea is not to go cold turkey but slowly reduce the amount of salt and sugar that you eat, which should be easier for people to follow. In another video, Rao asks whether the heart or the head should decide what you eat, concluding that health is a matter of the mind, so be smart about what you eat.

While government agencies have often laid down regulations for industry to push healthier food options, what has remained unaddressed is awareness among consumers. The Eat Right Movement aims to strike that balance. “It is the classic chicken-and-egg case. Consumers complain they do not have healthy options when they eat out or buy packaged food whereas the businesses say consumers do not want healthy options. So we thought how can we break this cycle? Businesses will have to take the first step while consumers have to become more aware of what they eat,” says Pawan Agarwal, CEO, FSSAI.

As a team at FSSAI fleshes out draft regulations on menu labelling and strategically bringing down high fat, salt and sugar content, the regulator reached out to industry, inviting voluntary commitments to initiate the process right away instead of waiting for the regulations to come into effect. “The labelling regulation was already being considered, but we thought if we wait for that to happen, it will take a year. We began to nudge the food businesses to start working towards healthier options. It had two major advantages. When they begin product reformulation in a few months, we at FSSAI will understand the practical problems in implementing it and that will help us bring in regulations with reasonable thresholds,” Agarwal says.

An issue that complicated the picture was that the draft regulations received push back from food companies because none of them wanted their food labeled red, or unhealthy. “According to thresholds in draft regulations, a significant part of their portfolio was being labeled red and hence, they were concerned,” Agarwal says. “If, as a regulator, we say that 80 per cent of the food available in the market is unhealthy, either consumers will ignore it completely or will have limited choice. We do not want a situation where we have standards or thresholds that are significantly different from current practices because reduction of HFSS will happen only over a period of time.”

With the World Health Organisation calling for a complete removal of trans fat from the food supply by 2023, the edible oil industry, bakeries and halwais in India, including Halwai Association and Hotel and Restaurant Association of Northern India, too, have pledged to do their bit, committing to phase it out by 2022 with the pledge ‘India@75 – freedom from trans fat by 2022.’ “As far as trans fat is concerned, we are coming up with regulations where edible oil cannot have more than two percent of trans fat and final food or bakery product will have not more than 0.5 percent. As soon as these standards are put in place, businesses will have to adhere to it and if they don’t, it will be a violation of the Food Safety Act and they will be liable for prosecution,” Agarwal says.

Fifteen companies from the packaged food industry – Nestle, Mapro, MTR, Britannia, Bikanervala, Patanjali, Bagrry’s, Hindustan Unilever, Weikfield, Kraft Heinz, Del Monte, Haldiram’s, Kellogs, ITC and Marico – have signed up with voluntary commitments to begin reducing salt and sugar in their products by 2020.

“It was an interesting journey to get the industry on board,” Agarwal says. “Though initially there were apprehensions, on the day of signing up for the initiative, they appeared more enthusiastic about it. Some of the enthusiasm might be tempered when they get down to the business, but we will take it forward from there. What was particularly heartening was to see the traditional halwais, the Haldiram and Bikanervala, get on board for this. There are major players like Dabur and Parle that are yet to come forward.”

Each company pledge is different. HUL has committed to reducing salt levels to enable intakes of 5g per day. In their tomato ketchup and sauces, for example, this means a 15 to 50 per cent reduction in sodium by 2020 to meet the benchmark of 750mg/100g. They have also pledged to reduce the sugar in their range of children’s frozen desserts to a maximum of 12g per portion in the same time frame. “Unilever committed long back to reformulate our products so as to reduce the salt, sugar and fat from our products gradually. The pledge which HUL has signed was just a reiteration of our commitment, which we are already working on for several years,” a company spokesperson said.

Likewise, Kraft Heinz will reduce the salt content in its tomato ketchup by 50 per cent in 2025 from its current levels, and to have nutrition declarations on the front of their packaging on all their products by the end of 2020; Kellogg will reduce sugar in their ready-to-eat cereals by 10 to 15 per cent and sodium by 10 to 30 per cent by 2020; Nestle will reduce sugar by 6 per cent on average and salt by 10 per cent by 2020, and MTR will reduce salt and sugar by 6 per cent and 5 per cent by 2025.

In addition to the nudge from government, these companies are also reacting to changing consumer preferences and greater awareness of the dangers of eating too much processed food. “Indian breakfast habits and food choices have seen some very interesting shifts over the last decade,” Mohit Anand, managing director, Kellogg South Asia, told Mirror, over email. “Changing lifestyle, travel, experiences, and essentially exposure to a variety of cuisines are significantly impacting changing consumer food choices and attitude towards food. Consumers like to experience ‘food’. Therefore, food is not just sustenance any more. Another obvious big trend is the rise of ‘health & wellness’. Therefore, an education initiative like the ‘Eat Right Movement’ is a multi-stakeholder effort that will empower consumers.”

Industry experts say that several unhealthy products like aerated drinks and vanaspati are being knocked off the shelves, thanks to gradually increasing awareness. “The consumption of vanaspati has been dwindling and production and consumption has gone down since 2012. Trans fatty acid content, which was between 6 to 10 percent in 2012, has been brought down to less than 5 percent in 2017. This is low as per WHO standards, but our commitment is to bring it down to 2 percent, and work is on to improve the interesterification process (a process that creates oil more suitable for deep frying). However, different countries have different consumption patterns. In Europe and the United States per person fat consumption is 45 kg per annum, while in India it is 13-14 kgs per person per annum,” explains Dr.KD Yadav, chairman of the technical committee of the Vanaspati Manufacturers Association.

In a bid to reach out to consumers, professional associations like the Nutrition Society of India, Indian Dietetic Association, Association of Food Scientists and Technologists (India), Indian Medical Association, and Indian Federation of Culinary Associations have come together to support the initiative.

“In India we eat much more salt in our food. While the recommended amount is not more than one teaspoon of salt per day an adult on an average, studies says twice the amount is actually used. We have a whole lot of salty snacks and evening snacking is a persistent habit… most snacks are high in fat and salt,” says Sheela Krishnaswamy, noted dietician and national president, Indian Dietetic Association. “Taste is an acquired thing. It can be changed over time. If we, say, reduce salt gradually and supplement it with more use of lime, herbs, and garlic that enhances taste and reduces requirement for salt, it can be done.”

Meanwhile Dr B Sasikeran, president, Nutrition Society of India and former director of National Institute of Nutrition, Indian Council of Medical Research, says that changes in diet need to be complemented by exercise. “The Eat Right Movement attempts to bring about social transformation by bringing in behavioral change. When you tell someone to reduce consumption, compliance is better than asking them to completely avoid it. But along with eating a little less, we also have to tell people to walk and exercise a little more. Once everyone gets into that mode, a year later this campaign can be further intensified,” he says.

The challenge for the food companies is, of course, balancing taste, cost and the relative healthiness of their products. “Stepwise reduction is key,” says Kellogg’s Anand. “We also work with our technologies to ensure that taste is not compromised, as we reduce the salt and sugar levels in a phased way. We take a consumer-centric approach on this, which means that we do not compromise on the taste while ensuring that we are delivering nutritious products.”

Ankur Bhaumik, the chief operating officer of MRT, admits that reformulation of their offerings will create challenges, but he is confident the company will find a way to adhere to their pledge. “There may not be new technology deployed to make these changes, but we are working with stakeholders to explore alternate solutions to help us achieve the target,” he says.

Similarly, Kraft Heinz will attempt to change the salt and sugar components of their tomato sauce while retaining its flavour. “The reformulated new recipe will not compromise on the quality and taste of the product, and will maintaining consumer affinity toward the brand,” says Sankalp Potbhare, the company’s managing director.”

Backed by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, FSSAI is hoping to work closely with other ministries such as Information and Broadcasting and Food Processing Industries among others to create a buzz around the campaign and weave in other government initiatives into the larger movement. While the body is banking on publicity through mass media, running ads and Rajkummar Rao’s two-minute video in movie halls and public events, it is set to tie up with the Ayushman Bharat project and hand out toolkits to health works at the 1.5 lakh health and wellness centers across the country to reach the rural populace.

FSSAI has also proposed that retail chains could nudge consumers to buy healthier food options by ensuring the ingredients and relative healthiness of their products are clearly marked at the points of sale. Of course, there is thin line between educating people about what to eat but leaving it to them to decide and telling people what to eat. The final choice should remain with the individual. If someone wants to eat a salty snack, or a candy bar, he or she should have that option. “Consumer choice should always prevail,” Anand says. “Moreover, there is nothing called ‘good’ or ‘bad’ food. It is about how one consumes those foods as part of the overall balanced diet. All foods have a place in consumers’ eating preferences and can definitely be eaten within a specific portion size.”

The Eat Right Movement has no choice but to play the long game. It will take years for changes in health indicators and lifestyle indicators to reflect, and it will be last 18 months before most of the companies introduce their new formulations. So the success or failure of the campaign will not be known for years to come. But it is a start and well begun, as they say, is half done."
15,2018-07-29,Nestle,"NEW DELHI: The domestic equity market had a terrific run last week, as it scaled fresh lifetime high. However, only select largecaps lifted the equities higher while broader market continued to struggle.

A better-than-expected quarterly numbers from companies, including ITC, Colgate-Palmolive, JSW Steel, YES Bank, Biocon and Dr Reddy's nudged the bulls to take big strides, lifting frontline indices to fresh milestones. Other factors that compelled investors to fall for equities included reduction in GST rates on over 100 items, FIIs buying again and positive global cues.

On a weekly basis, the BSE Sensex gained 840 points, or 2.3 per cent, while the 50-share pack surged 268 points, or 2.4 per cent.

Going ahead, it's going to be a policy week as many major central banks are going to declare their monetary policy. 

Here’s an in-depth look at these and other factors that are likely to steer market this week - 


RBI's rate-setting meetingThe RBI's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is slated to meet during July 30 to August 1 for the third bi-monthly monetary policy statement for 2018-2019. The six-member monetary policy committee of the central bank headed by Governor Urjit Patel in June meet bit the bullet and hiked the repo rate – the short-term lending rate – by 25 basis points to 6.25 per cent.

Speculations are rife that the bank will hike interest rates for second time on Wednesday as inflation risks mount. 


Next batch of quarterly earningsCorporate earnings will continue to dominate the Street's proceedings in the coming week. Among notable names, Axis Bank, HDFC, Idea Cellular, Tech Mahindra, IDFC and Shree Cement are slated to declare their June quarter results on Monday. Bank of India, Dabur India, Power Grid Corporation of India, Tata Motors and Vedanta will announce theirs on Tuesday. Indiabulls Housing Finance and Marico are expected to unveil their report cards on Thursday. Nestle India and Titan Company will declare theirs on Friday.


US Fed meetUS Federal Reserve will announce its interest rate decision on Wednesday. The Fed had hiked its benchmark short-term interest rate a quarter percentage point in June and indicated that two more increases are likely this year. The move pushed the funds rate target to 1.75 per cent to 2 per cent.


BoJ and BoEBank of Japan (BoJ) will unveil its interest rate decision on Tuesday. According to a report by Reuters, it might be doing some ‘jinarashi’ i.e. preparing markets for some changes to its unique, ultra-loose monetary policy. BoJ had left its key short-term interest rate unchanged at -0.1 per cent at its June 2018 meeting.

This apart, Bank of England (BoE) will declare its interest rate decision on Thursday. Governor Mark Carney is looking to throw off his “unreliable boyfriend” tag and do what he and his colleagues have been threatening to do for a while - raise UK interest rates by a quarter point to 0.75 per cent, reports Reuters.

2,2018-08-02,Nestle,"NEW DELHI: If you have managed to make money in stocks this year, consider yourself lucky. Reason? 

Disparity on display is at its best on Dalal Street this year, and the number of haven’ts have far outnumbered the haves!

For instance, 14 top gainers in terms of market capitalisation have this year swelled their market value by Rs 10 lakh crore, while 2,900 stocks have lost the same amount in this period.

Half of this humongous loss was contributed by 950-odd constituents of BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices, which fell 10-15 per cent in the first seven months. 

Analysts say such disparity is abnormal and would not last long. 

Some 2,300 of the 2,900-odd stocks have seen value erosion so far this year, and barring the top 14, the ones that have created wealth for investors have failed to wipe out this loss.



The total market value of the BSE-listed stocks stood at Rs 153 lakh crore at the end of Wednesday’s trade against Rs 152 lakh crore on December 31, 2017.

“Historically, whenever a meltdown has happened in smallcaps and midcaps, it has lasted 2-3 years. But I do think the current selloff that started in January will last beyond 6-8 months,” said G Chokkalingam, Founder, Equinomics Research & Advisory.

He said the top performing largecap stocks are trading at 5 to 10 times price-to-book value, which is not sustainable.

Data shows TCS alone has added Rs 2.26 lakh crore to its market value. At the end of July, it was the most valued firm on Dalal Street at Rs 7.43 lakh crore.

Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank, Infosys, HDFC and IT are some of the bluest of the blue chips that have contributed most to BSE's market value this year.

Others, such as Bajaj Finance, Avenue Supermarts, Bajaj Finserv, Nestle India and Indiabulls Ventures, too, have made significant contribution. 

While companies such as Bajaj Auto, Punjab National Bank, NTPC, ONGC and OMCs have led the laggards, there was no dearth of midcaps that erased investor wealth. 

Popular names such as Vakrangee, HPCL, Bharat Electronics, PC Jeweller, TVS Motor Company, NBCC (India), Mangalore Refinery & Petrochemicals and Sun TV Network are among the midcaps that have seen heavy value erosion in past seven months. Data suggests 53 per cent of BSE Midcap and BSE Smallcap stocks were down in excess of 20 per cent this year.

Risk aversion was the biggest reason for the shift in investor focus towards largecaps. Sebi’s reclassification of market-caps triggered a selloff in midcaps and smallcaps by many of the largecap-oriented mutual fund schemes, which weighed on market sentiment.

The bearishness only intensified with Sebi’s trading curbs on several lower-rung stocks. 

Ace investor Shankar Sharma in a recent tweet called it a technical factor. “Two types of bear markets: fundamental & technical. Fundamentals in smallcaps are intact. So what’s caused the meltdown? Technical factors, i.e. trading curbs, hence low liquidity, hence forced selling into illiquidity, leading to a domino effect collapse of the entire segment,” Sharma said.

 A few brokerages have noted that despite Nifty's outperformance vis-à-vis the midcap index, several midcaps are still trading at up to 8 per cent premium. 

This, even as Nifty’s earnings estimates have got upgraded by 4.5 per cent and 2.1 per cent for FY19 and FY20 and Nifty Midcap100 earnings downgraded by 1.4 per cent and 1.3 per cent, respectively.

One should strictly stick to quality stocks at this point, they said. 

Elara Capital said it continues to prefer largecaps over midcaps and within midcaps investors should stick to quality."

Hiring is an art unto itself. Most founders will vouch for the difficulty in picking “culturally fit” people. While it’s an important attribute to watch out for, PayPal India head Anupam Pahuja believes that leaders can often be impatient in their expectations towards new hires.

“In this hire-and-fire world, it’s easy to fire people,” said Pahuja during his recent visit to Mumbai. 

“The days of longevity and tenure, at least in MNCs, are gone. Nobody cares. It’s very transactional in nature. However, I feel the opposite. What’s important is not a bad hire but what to do about it.”

Illustrating his point, Singapore-based Pahuja said that when you bring five people together, it is inevitable that one or two may not fit in with everyone else.

“Your tendency could easily be ‘Arre yaar, kya dimaag kharab karenge [Why rack your brains?]. Get rid of this guy’. It’s very easy to do that. What is difficult is to develop that person and see how he can attain the stature you saw in them,” Pahuja said.

According to Pahuja, diversity of opinion, thought, feeling, or anything, is not necessarily encouraged by many people. This, he says, is the worst thing you (as a leader) could do to a company because it sends a wrong message to the employees.

So, what’s his strategy? Pahuja believes that he would have seen some qualities that match the overall culture of the organisation, which would have led to hiring that person.

The company, which follows January-December financial year, had posted a net profit of Rs 263.43 crore for the April-June quarter of 2017-18.

Total income during the quarter stood at Rs 2,758.63 crore. It was Rs 2,525.96 crore in April-June, 2017-18, Nestle said in a BSE filing.

The company said financial results for the reported quarter are not comparable as sales for the June quarter 2017 were reported gross of Excise Duty and net of Value Added Tax (VAT)/ Sales Tax. Excise duty was reported as a separate expense line item.

""Consequent to the introduction of GST with effect from July 1 2017, VAT/Sales Tax, Excise duty etc have been subsumed into GST and accordingly the same is not recognised as part of sales,"" the company said.

""The market momentum continued to be favourable and...we have sustained our broad based volume growth across categories. There is an improvement in margins due to favourable cost of commodities and cost efficiency programmes.

""However, we are now witnessing headwinds in commodity prices,"" Nestle India Chairman and Managing Director Suresh Narayanan said.

The company said its total sales and domestic sales increased 8.5 per cent and 8 per cent, respectively in the reported quarter.

""The growth rates are adversely impacted due to lower reported sales by the change in structure of indirect taxes and reduction in realisations to pass on the GST benefits.

""On a comparable basis, domestic sales growth is 'estimated' at 14.5 per cent supported by increase in volumes on a base impacted by softer trading ahead of the rollout of GST,"" the company added.

Nestle India's total expenses were up 1.49 per cent to Rs 2,163.32 crore as against Rs 2,131.39 crore in the same quarter a year ago.

For the first half of 2018, the company's net profit also went up 43.64 per cent to Rs 819.06 crore as against Rs 570.19 crore earlier.

The total income during January-June, 2018-19 was at Rs 5,572.3 crore. It was Rs 5,159.46 crore in the same period a year ago.

Meanwhile, in a separate filing, Nestle informed its Board of Directors has declared second interim dividend for 2017-18 of Rs 20 per equity share.

8,2018-08-06,Nestle,"Nestle India's instant noodles brand Maggi has attained over 60 per cent market share and almost touched the pre-crisis level in value terms, said a top company official. However, volume-wise Maggi is still away from the pre-crisis period, when Nestle used to dominate the market with 75 per cent market share. 

""We are little over 60 per cent (market share). In business terms, we are almost back to where we were (in terms of pre-crisis). In value terms, we are almost back there,"" said Nestle India Chairman and Managing Director Suresh Narayanan. 

He further said, ""We still have some time to catch up that pre-crisis volume."" 

Presently, Maggi contributes around one-third of the total sales of the company. 

""Total contribution from the prepared foods (Maggi and Maggi franchise) is about 30 per cent,"" said Narayanan in a media roundtable here. 

Nestle India had in 2017 crossed the Rs 10,000-crore sales mark. 

Maggi was banned by Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) in June 2015 for five months for allegedly containing lead beyond permissible limits, forcing Nestle India to withdraw the product from the market. 

Following legal battles, the popular noodles brand was back in the market in November 2015."
9,2018-08-06,Nestle,"NEW DELHI: Packaged foods maker Nestle is open to evaluating ‘strategic or bolt-on acquisition opportunities provided these fit with the company’s long-term growth strategy’, company chairman Suresh Narayanan said here today.

“Any inorganic opportunity in the market is evaluated by Nestle. But it will depend on the long term strategic fit,” Narayanan said, while addressing the media to announce the noodles-and-chocolate maker’s expansion plans in the small but rapidly growing breakfast space. 

Milk food drinks Horlicks from GSK Consumer and Kraft Heinz’s Complan are both on the block and Nestle is learnt to be one of the potential bidders for the brands. 

Narayanan also said the company will reduce sugar, salt, fat across its brands by 6-10% over the next two-three years, under Nestle’s global defined commitments. 

Commenting on market share of flagship brand Maggi which was pulled off shelves three years back for a period of five months on allegations of excess use of lead and mislabeling of flavour enhancer monosodium glutamate, Narayanan said the Maggi franchise was at currently at a share of over 60%, almost back to the pre-crisis. 

He said the company was rolling out new products such as Maggi dips and KitKat dark chocolate this quarter. 

Nestle India reported a profit increase of 50% to Rs 395 crore for the June ’18 quarter on higher margins and sales realisations."
10,2018-08-07,Nestle,"There might be a relief rally in India for some time, as India Inc’s June quarter earnings have come out quite well, says Samir Arora, a Dalal Street veteran and founder and fund manager of Singapore-based Helios Capital.

Equity benchmarks BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty are currently hovering around their life-time high levels. “Right now, the market is reacting positively to the earnings and the focus will shift towards elections may be after 30 days,” he said. 

In an interaction with Avanne Dubash of ETNow, the fund manager shared his views on market outlook, his sectoral preferences and what he is betting on in the current market. 

Sectorwise, he believes 60-70 per cent of the pain in the telecom sector is over, but Reliance Jio will continue to add stress in the sector. 

Arora is bullish on two themes in India – financialisation and formalisation. He said the pain point for public sector banks seems to be plateauing. But he is not buying PSU banks as yet due to the weak underlying fundamentals. “I buy a business when I feel I am going to hold it forever,” he said.

Arora says consumer stables are commanding very high P/E in India in the consumption space. “I own only Nestle within the staples space,” he said. 

He also owns companies from air conditioner as well as media space within the consumption space.

Arora doesn’t see any real reform in the oil marketing sector anytime soon and is avoiding the OMCs at current levels. 

He says he does not buy Tata Motors type of companies. “We like Indian companies rather than global ones. It has nothing to do with India, apart from listing in India. We bet on India, not on Indians,” he said. 

He regretted having missed the bus in the IT sector by not owning the two big companies. “Forex moves are tampering gains for IT,” Arora said.

Commenting on the pharma sector, he said he does not think much has changed in this space. “The government is trying to control prices in the pharma sector, which is a matter of concern,” he said."

  tells ET Now. Arora continues to be bullish on both themes.Edited excerpts:


Sometime back, you had tweeted that “with a market like this and with a scenario like this, we need more inspirational quotes.” Why are you cautious at a time like this? Are you upbeat?
That was last month and those were the peak bad days.


Things are changing?
Since then, the market is giving inspiration because it seems to have bottomed out and doing a little better and currencies are doing a little better as well. May be, now we need more quotes, and green colour on the screen.


Which is what we are seeing but in terms of what you are looking at as the next big trigger, would we have to live with the fact that crude is going to remain around these levels and global tensions would continue? What is going to be on top of your mind?
Right now, there might be a relief rally in India which may continue for some time. In the US, people are looking at results rather than other things because the results are coming out quite well. Once this phase gets over in another 30 days, may be people will look at the way the three elections turn out. Now, the market is being driven by earnings and as the earnings are good, the market is reacting positively to that.


You had spoken a short while ago about Bharti being a success story earlier in the day. How have things changed in the telecom space with this aggressive pricing competition and Rel Jio causing so much disruption? What is your view?
Right now, we feel that although 60-70% of the pain is over, Reliance has not reached the required numbers that would make it back off and say okay. I have reached my penetration target and now I want to concentrate on making money and till that time, the stress for others will definitely continue.


It is visible right now as well.
Absolutely.


Way back in the ‘90s when it came to reforms, there was a lot of focus on opening up the economy to private companies. Today it is about formalisation. What have you made of the kind of reforms that have been undertaken by the Modi government?
We are now most bullish on two reforms or themes which is financialisation and formalisation. Financialisation is more of an ongoing process. There is more financial penetration in people’s lives. Formalisation, which has come not only from GST but also brands, may come from online because when you go online you will normally buy something more organised or brand related. That would continue a little bit and GST proved to be a trigger.


You had also said that the best analyst when it comes to the PSU mess etc. is going to be the RBI. How have you read into this problem? Are people getting too worried or is it justified?
Right now, may be from a stock market sense, the pain point is over. The stock market only looks at year-on-year numbers and quarter-on-quarter there is a plateauing out, but I do not buy stocks like that. I want to buy a business which at least that day I feel I am going to hold forever and not just because for one or two quarters, the numbers will look better. In reality, nothing is changed except time. We are not buying but we do not have any shorts anymore in state owned banks which we would have held for two-three years. 


What is a bit puzzling when it comes to the consumption theme is that the PEs are fairly high. It is a good story but how are you looking at this theme right now?
In the consumer theme, these very high PEs come in consumer staples in which we owned only one stock, Nestle. We buy the consumer discretionary times which also have very high PEs but they are cheaper than the 60 PE for staples. They are more like 20 to 40 PE. We own the AC companies and one or two media type companies. 

In India, a company like say Nestle will be 60 PE, in other markets, it will be 20. Levers here will be 50, in UK, it will be 20. That is the reality and we do not fight it beyond a point because we look at history within India. Now there is no point in saying this is what it is.


How you are looking at the linkage of crude oil prices to some of the oil marketing companies? Do you believe that we could see some amount of pressure?
We do not believe that there was a real reform in that sector. We have never bought it and we were short. If oil were to really go up, I do not believe the reforms will work because elections will be near and you will delay and all that. We would not buy them at any situation.


Coming to the next big phase of disruption, what about EVs? Do you think Indian companies like Tata Motors, are going to adapt to this?
We would not buy Tata Motors type companies because we do not buy global companies. We buy Indian companies. It has nothing to do with India except it happens to be listed in India. We bet on India and that means just because it is an Indian-owned company, I cannot analyse it. I do not know what are the luxury cars tax rules in China and what BMW is doing. I do not want to engage in such thing that relative to India it is cheap or not. I have no interest. We do not buy it on too-complex-to-understand logic.


How are you looking at IT as a space? Lot of companies are talking about focussing on digital. Have you read into the earnings so far? What do you make of the story?
We have missed that one by not owning the two big companies. But now, we justify by saying that they have gone up too much. We are not buying to feel better. In the last seven-eight years, numbers for these companies have actually gone nowhere in the criterion of per user. They are coming into SMAC and digital and all that. Their revenues do not increase. If you look at the fact that currency has depreciated, their margins do not increase. 

Of course, their size increased in the case of TCS a little bit. But today, getting a 10-12-14-15% earnings growth with the dollar having strengthened and the rupee weakened, we justify by saying some other time.


Is the story in what was considered a defensive -- pharmaceuticals -- still intact or are you worried?
We will be worried if it was intact because we do not have any exposure there. We do not believe that anything much has changed because it is still stock by stock. We own one stock but we do not call it pharma story in the sense. When you say pharma story, it should be common across the pharma sector."
12,2018-08-08,Nestle,"Large consumer goods makers and auto companies have forecast growth of about 10% in the next six months in the approach to the upcoming general election in 2019 that will see substantially increased liquidity in the market.

“We are expecting growth of 7-12% over the next two quarters,” said Nestle India chairman Suresh Narayanan. “The run-up to the general election leads to more cash in the hands of the consumer and that liquidity directly translates into increased consumption for categories as ours.”

Narayanan said this growth would be on top of a rise in demand as the goods and services tax (GST) settles in, besides the festive season uptick in consumer sentiment later on in the year. Analysts said valuations in both sectors—consumer and auto— are expected to remain high over the next six months.

Political parties are expected to rain largesse on potential voters, especially in key rural markets, boosting consumer demand in the hinterland, they said.

The recent hike in minimum support prices (MSP) and farm loan waivers are expected to add to this. The election is scheduled to be held by May next year.

“We expect this year to be a consumption year,” said Varun Berry, managing director of the country’s largest biscuit maker Britannia. “While elections are a key driver, the other macros such as rural stimulus by the government are already showing a steady pickup in growth momentum.”

In the auto sector, demand will be broadbased and not restricted to a few players such as Maruti Suzuki or Honda Motorcycle as has been for some time now, experts said.

In the April-June period, the passenger vehicle market grew 20% and the two-wheeler segment was up 16%. Ahead of the festive season, vehicle and component makers are operating at optimum capacity to cater to the expected demand spurt.

Mahindra & Mahindra, the country's second largest utility vehicle maker, which gets about 35-40% of its sales from rural areas, said the run-up to the elections has a direct impact on demand for vehicles such as the Bolero. There are indirect benefits for segments such as tractors thanks to measures like higher MSP.

All vehicle segments benefit as there is more money in the hands of the buyers, said VS Parthasarthy, Mahindra & Mahindra group CFO. “It is a clear case of supply and demand. Higher the liquidity, more is the propensity to buy.”

Companies such as Dabur and Marico, which derive nearly half their sales from rural markets, also see elections as a key growth driver.

“As we head into elections, we expect the government to announce additional stimulus that will substantially enhance the spending power in the hinterland with disposable income in the pockets of rural consumers,” said Sunil Duggal, chief executive of Dabur, which makes Real juices and Vatika haircare products. 

“Riding on these factors, we expect a sustained improvement in demand.” The consumer and automobile sectors, dependent on rural markets, have reported the fastest volume growth in at least five years in the April-June quarter, riding on positive macroeconomic indicators and a low year-ago base as GST was rolled out in July 2017.

GST on about 200 items was slashed in November, giving a further impetus to consumption. More cuts have been announced since then.

Companies such as Maruti Suzuki, Hindustan Unilever, Dabur, Bajaj Auto and Marico are among the ones that grew the most in over five years.

JM Financial Institutional Securities wrote in a report last month that higher MSP for crops is a clear indication of increased growth rates. “Subdued MSP increase had adversely impacted crop profitability and farmer income growth; the present MSP hikes will likely boost income growth, particularly for the paddy growing farmers, given the existing procurement for paddy,” it wrote.

Revenue growth in the Rs 3.4 lakh crore fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector is expected to increase to 11-12% in FY19 from about 8% in FY18, driven by a revival in rural demand owing to external factors, a Crisil report said.

“This will lead to a significant improvement in the operating performance of FMCG companies and benefit their credit profiles,” the report added."
13,2018-08-08,Nestle,"From a valuation perspective, do not buy everything just because it seems to be going up: Deepak Shenoy, Founder, Capital Mind, tells ET Now. 
  
  
  Edited excerpts:

A lot of people are saying the market will be rising higher. We are getting aggressive targets of Nifty moving towards 12,000, 13,000 and 14,000 in six months, one year, two years. How are you viewing market? Do you have valuation comfort at these levels or do you feel that this is a stock specific market and not a broad-based rally?
To be honest, all markets are stock specific. Very few markets will move based on the index. But having said that, the index level valuations in some stocks are at crazy new extremes. Yesterday, they had the second highest PE number on the Nifty ever since early 2000s when it was higher than this.

Secondly, we have got earnings growth as a whole at an abysmal 3% or 4% on Nifty. You are not seeing earnings recovery happening just now. For last three years, it has been suspect. Nifty next 50 is also at an all-time high in PE terms.


There has been a huge change in composition of Nifty index over last 10 or 15 years. Earlier, we had more of manufacturing companies where PE has to be less. Today we are in an index dominated by financials and FMCGs where PE has to be high. Is it right to compare 10-year-old data with current PE?
Well yes. At the index level we have 50 stocks. It is true some are FMCG companies and some are financial services. But why are we giving banks 30 PEs? We used to give banks 7 PEs earlier. They are not even growing at the same rate as they used to. We used to give IT companies 100 times earnings. Today we are giving them only 10 times earnings. PE numbers of individual stock or sectors basis will change but as an aggregate on a broad index, 50 stock indexes are reasonably good.

If you do not grow your PE or your PE goes haywire, you should at least be seeing earnings growth. You are seeing PE expansion but no earnings growth on aggregate. Your manufacturing company base changed to financial service or a FMCG company base today. If earnings on aggregate are not growing, then we are paying too much. It is wrong.

If you look at the PE metrics for the last one year, very often caution is not abundantly stated and sometimes you just give up saying that this is overvalued just because markets not going down. But it is in my opinion. Having said that, individual stock stories still continue with basically great earnings in some stocks. I would still stay stock specific, I am still a buyer. I have not shorted the market and from a valuation perspective, I would say do not buy everything just because it seems to be going up.


We are seeing private banks making a comeback. ICICI Bank is up by 1.63% and I am not just referring to today’s price action. Axis Bank and ICICI Bank have been making a comeback at the cost of IndusInd Bank, Kotak Bank and HDFC Bank. These stocks have not been performing now. May be people will not increase the exposure towards banking space to accommodate ICICI Bank and Axis Bank in their portfolio once again and that is the reason we are seeing cut in stance when it comes to HDFC Bank, Kotak or IndusInd. Is this the right way to think?
There is another round of NPAs coming and this is primarily because there is another AQR with the RBI. There will be obviously an NCLT four level suggestions on cross- industry NPA recognition. Both these factors will lead to Axis and ICICI getting impacted more than HDFC, Kotak or IndusInd. Therefore, if you were to make a choice between them, one should stick with HDFC, Kotak, IndusInd and may be a Yes Bank. There are some corporate problems in Yes Bank as well.

If you are willing to own some of the newer banks, then an RBL or may be a Bandhan Bank can be considered after may a be couple of quarters’ results because the NPA cycle there is in a much more controlled fashion. I would say allocating more to the financial sector may not be a good thing, given interest rates are rising. But if you were in that, then I would concentrate on HDFC, Kotak and IndusInd.


Some of the high value expensive names include Reliance Industries, Piramal Enterprises or for that matter, the newly listed entity HDFC AMC. Do you continue to chase quality and do you buy them at that expensive price?
I wish I could say yes but the most expensive stock I am buying is probably Maruti. There are reasons to buy these stocks. Reliance is not actually very expensive if you look at it from an earnings multiple perspective. It is probably just higher priced than it was two or three years back but historically it has been valued at much higher. 

But stocks like the FMCG biggies are at 80x and 70x. Britannia or Nestle are good quality companies but I do not know whether you would pay the price of a Mercedes Benz for a Maruti. It is just not the same thing. You are not going to get the value for your money at these prices. It is okay to be in cash and so we still retain a reasonable cash position. 

We are still buying some of the smaller cap companies and even the large caps companies where valuations are lower. Maybe a Hero MotorCorp or two-wheeler companies because I can see some growth coming in from earnings in the longer term there. I do not see that happening in some of the larger names. If you pay a high PE, then expect high growth in earnings. But that is not happening and my theory is that I would not buy it.


Why are you sitting on high levels of cash right now? Do you sense that the market is getting a little toppish?
We are probably 30-40% in cash, which is fine. We do not see that having been fully invested will give us great returns five years from now. So, it does not make sense unless you are trading momentum or you are trading short term to be completely invested.

If you are a long-term investor, you should keep some cash at hand. It is historically all times when valuations were at these levels that we have seen corrections. In corrections, you need to be in cash because you need to be able to buy. 

We have kept that cash position and we are happy. We still participate 60-70% of the positions but we are not going to completely put our money in right now because this is not the time."
14,2018-08-09,Nestle,"By Shannon Tellis
Before there was Zuckerberg, there was Pierre Omidyar, the man behind the world’s largest online classifieds. 

As eBay shuts shop in India, here are interesting facts about the maverick founder and philanthropist:

1. Pierre Omidyar was actually born in Paris as Parviz Omidyar. His parents were Iranian immigrants who migrated to France to study at French universities and gifted him the popular Iranian name, meaning ‘fortunate’ or ‘victorious’. Omidyar and his family later moved to Baltimore, US when his father did his residency at the Johns Hopkins University Medical Centre.

2. His fascination with computers began early. Omidyar used to sneak out of physical education and spend hours at his high school PC. So much so that his principal “punished” him by making him write a program to print the school’s library cards. The teen earned $6 an hour for the program.

3. The company now known as eBay, actually started off with Pez candy dispensers. Omidyar was also doing some freelance web designing, while working as a developer relations engineer in 1994. At the time, his then-girlfriend, now-wife Pamela Wesley complained that she couldn’t find like-minded Pez dispenser collectors on the Internet. So Omidyar began an auction service on his personal web page for Wesley to find her Pez community.

4. At the age of 28, Omidyar wrote the code for and launched an online auction service — Auction Web — which would eventually become global auction site eBay (inspired by Echo Bay recreational lake). Within three years of that launch, Omidyar was inducted into the billion dollar club, thanks to its IPO in 1998. Today, Omidyar owns just 5.7 percent of eBay and his net worth is estimated to be $9.23 billion.

5. What made eBay unique was Omidyar’s implicit trust in people. When he launched the company, he wrote a manifesto declaring that “most people are honest” and set up a forum where users could assign each other positive and negative ratings. This allowed eBay to keep away from inventory hassles and leave market regulation to the buyers and sellers themselves — a game-changing strategy. By 1997, eBay was hosting 200,000 auctions a month.

6. In 1998, Omidyar decided to switch gears to philanthropy. With Wesley, he launched the Omidyar Foundation to support a range of causes like poverty alleviation, human rights and disaster relief. To date, they have contributed more than $1 billion and were honoured with the Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy in 2011 for their efforts.

7. Over the past 10 years, Omidyar has been a staunch supporter of a free press. For example, last year he pledged $4.5 million to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) that broke the Panama Papers story. He launched First Look Media in 2013 to promote investigative journalism. It also funds fact-checking organisations across the world like The Intercept, which was initially founded to report on the documents released by Edward Snowden.

8. Despite his fingers in so many pies, Omidyar remains a recluse and happily so. In an interview, he said, “I do like to fly under the radar. When I walk around town, the only people I want to recognise me and call me by my name are the folks at Starbucks.”

Within hours it went viral. Understaffed and overwhelmed, we all took on the task at hand and started answering calls. We also had to figure a way to increase our delivery capacity — fast. It was a mad shuffle as we cut deals with temporary staffing agencies, and, at some point, we had to stop taking orders. The next few hours went in responding to irate customers.

16,2018-08-10,Nestle,"NEW DELHI: As India’s equity benchmarks rule at lifetime peaks, with heartbeat index Sensex sprinting 1,000 points in 10 sessions, investor faces on Dalal Street wear more worry lines than euphoria.

You do not see the Nifty50 rule at a price-to-earnings multiple of 28 too often! In last 18 years, this has happened only twice before; on both occasions it ended up in quite a bit of bloodletting.

And then, there are some so-called growth stocks whose PE multiples have soared to anywhere between 80 and 100; expensive by any measure. Does it mean the ongoing rally in stocks is nearing a climax?

Dalal Street is divided. One school of thought says there is no harm stay put in high PE stocks as long as there is growth, while the other says it’s time to go beyond frontline companies to explore value in mid-quality stocks.

Prevailing market conditions are constantly reminding investors of the Nifty peak point in 2000, when a select few of technology, media and telecommunication (TMT) – the new economy trio – had led the show and lifted Nifty50 to a P/E level of 28 on a trailing basis.

This year too, only a handful of Nifty50 stocks have been pushing the index to new all-time highs every second day.

Most of India’s midcap and smallcap stocks are off their January highs by an average 16 per cent, reflecting lack of depth of the current rally. This has been unlike the 2007 rally, when the bull run was broad-based,

Some analysts say though Nifty P/E valuation looks expensive on a trailing basis, its price-to-book value – a ratio that maps price escalation relative to the value of total assets on balance sheets – still looks manageable at 3.7.

The Indian market, they say, is in a structural bull run, where earnings are showing signs of revival. Investors should remain mindful of growth prospects, they say.


High P/Es for how long?
But the average investor still has a dilemma: Will earnings keep justifying high PEs? 

Among BSE500 stocks, there are many NBFCs such as Equitas Holdings, Indiabulls Venture and Bajaj Finance, which are trading at price multiples of 60-160, data available with corporate database Ace Equity shows.

Shares of consumption-oriented companies such as Page Industries, Gillette, P&G, Britannia Industries, Jubilant FoodWorks, Hindustan Unilever, Dabur India, Nestle India, Marico and Emami are ruling at PEs ranging from 60 to 100. Select paints and discretionary stocks are hovering at even higher valuations.

Smallcap investor Porinju Veliyath, Founder & CEO at Equity Intelligence India, says one needs to find a balance between quality and value.

Look out for medium quality companies in the midcap and smallcap segment, he says.

The top 10-15 high quality largecaps, whose profit margins are at peak levels, and other operational parameters are at their best, may end up reporting compounded annual growth rates of around 5-10 per cent over next five years, while medium-quality midcaps and smallcaps may see 30-35 per cent earnings growth.


Price of a Mercedes for a Maruti?There are over 5,000 listed companies in India, but Porinju finds only 1,000 of them ‘investible’. “You need to select 15-20 of them, which is what is called value picking,” he said.

“I do not know whether you would pay the price of a Mercedes Benz for a Maruti. They are not going to get the values for your money at these prices,” says Deepak Shenoy, Founder at Gurgaon-based investing firm Capital Mind.

“The most expensive stock I am buying is probably Maruti. There are reasons to buy these stocks. But stocks like the FMCG biggies Britannia or Nestle are at 70-80 times. While you know, these are good quality companies, if you pay a high P/E, you also expect high growth in earnings. If that is not happening, I would not buy it,” Shenoy told ETNow. He says he continues to retain a reasonable cash position.

On Thursday, Veliyath in a tweet questioned the logic of investing in businesses which are at their peak operational efficiencies and environment, quoting P/E ratios near the 100 mark and have been giving guidance for 20 per cent CAGR growth for next 20 years. “Don’t you think it’s time to be cautious?” he asked.

In another tweet, Veliyath noted that even in April 2015 investors were being advised to buy highest quality largecaps such as Sun Pharma at Rs 1,200 and Lupin at Rs 2,100 as they were considered ‘very safe’.

“I see similar stories today in certain fancied sectors at 70-80 P/E multiples,” he said.

Sun Pharma shares are down 33 per cent in last three years and Lupin 52 per cent.


Consumption story unfolding
Not all analysts are this cautious on consumer stocks. Some believe the outlook is improving for the consumer-focused franchises. At the most, there could be a time correction, they say.

Some consumption-focused franchises are indeed trading at forbidding valuations. Some of these stocks will possibly see some time correction, says Ajay Bodke of Prabhudas Lilladher.

June quarter numbers of consumer-focussed franchises suggest strong growth dynamics. This is true not only for FMCG companies, but also some others. Quick service restaurants are seeing very strong same-store sales growth; auto and auto ancillary franchises are seeing solid sales volumes and even retail-focused private banks and NBFCs showing great traction, Bodke pointed out during an interview with ETNow

FMCG companies are posting very strong double-digit volume growth, where rural growth has been a few percentage points higher than urban growth. This is the second quarter on a trot when they have managed to sustain these double-digit volume growth numbers.

What is heartening is that the pricing power has come back to accompany this double-digit volume growth, leading to strong sustained growth in Ebitda levels, says Bodke. 


Growth hold key
Bodke says as long as the underlying earnings growth remains between, say, 25 per cent and 35 per cent, with strong working capital management – one can remain positive on these franchises.

Many of these companies have been operating on negative working capital.

If monsoon outcome is near normal, the growth impulses on the consumption side will strengthen post harvest around Dussehra and Diwali in the second half of the year. “We are pencilling in stronger growth for these consumer-focused franchises. Our allocation remains heavily focused on these franchises – FMCG, retail companies, auto and auto ancillaries and retail-focused consumer franchises,” Bodke said."
15,2018-08-10,Nestle,"A strong moat with huge opportunities can give you that adrenaline rush. 

Britannia Industries Managing Director Varun Berry firmly believes so. He sees two crucial factors going for the company that's difficult to spot in any of its peers. 

In the pipeline are 50 new products this year to mark the company's 100 years of operations.

Returns are an eye opener. The scrip soared 54 per cent and 101 per cent during the last one year and three years, respectively, as against 17 per cent and 33 per cent of the benchmark Sensex during the same period.

Britannia even went up 775 per cent and 2,192 per cent over the last 5 years and 10 years, respectively. Which meant market capitalisation of the company moved to nearly Rs 76,000 crore, from Rs 3,200 crore, during August 2008-18.

Berry highlighted that the first moat for Britannia is the brand itself and his 30-year plus experience in the consumer industry. “What I have seen is that you can do a lot of stuff, but you cannot build brands in a hurry. So, that is our big moat and I think that is something that no one can match,” he said in an interaction with ETNow. 

He sees low-cost operation as the second moat for Britannia. “I do not think that there is any company which operates with the kind of costs that we operate,” Berry asserted.

The term moat is popularised by legendary investor Warren Buffett referring to businesses that maintained competitive advantages over its competitors. 

The market guru once said: ""A good business is like a strong castle with a deep moat around it. I want sharks in the moat. I want it untouchable."" 

Motial Oswal has ‘Buy’ call on Britannia with a target price of Rs 7,300. The brokerage house sees 28.40 per cent and 27.90 per cent rise in net profit and EBITDA of Britannia in FY19.

Emkay Global Financial Services in a report said, “We expect sales and earnings CAGR of 15 per cent and 20 per cent over FY18-21E. The stock is trading at 52x FY20E EPS after the 25 per cent run-up over the last 5 months. We believe that the current valuation offers limited upside and hence, we downgrade it to ‘Hold’ from ‘Accumulate’. We roll forward our target price to Rs 6,100 (previously Rs 5,850) valuing it at 45x September 20E EPS (in-line with Nestle and HUL).”

Top line as well as the bottom line of the company has already grown in double digits during the past 10 years. Net sales and net profit of the biscuit major grew 14 per cent and 19 per cent on a CAGR basis during FY08-18. 

According to market experts, with the GST rollout, the company will see some traction in the long term as organised players see market share gains. This space is seeing a shift from the value segment towards the premium one and Britannia is well poised to ride this wave. 

Also, the company is widening its reach in rural India. Their reach in rural pockets now stands at around 75 per cent of their urban reach.

For 2017-18, Britannia posted net sales of Rs 9,905.60 crore against Rs 2,776.30 crore in FY08. Net profit jumped to Rs 1,004.20 crore, from Rs 177.40 crore before.

Elara Capital in a report in July said, “Britannia has high distributor margins and investments are the lowest as they are aiming at 'zero inventory' days.” 

It added: “Britannia has high margin. Investment is the lowest and the volume is high. This makes good net profits from distributor’s perspective. Unilever and Nestle need more investments - RoI (return on investment) is lower. Marico is also low inventory -- just one day of inventory. The rest all are same across companies.” 

Britannia Industries, which earns 70 per cent of its revenue from the biscuits segment, would gradually increase the pie of non-biscuits category by foraying into new product space. In value terms, Britannia's market share in the biscuits category is 33 per cent.

Addressing shareholders during the company's 99th annual general meeting, Berry said Good Day is within striking distance of Parle G. 

""We are the number one biscuit maker and far ahead of Parle in market share. We expect Good Day to overtake Parle G in next 2-3 years,"" said Berry.

The company recently came out with a new logo and also proposed a stock split and issue of bonus debentures, subject to necessary approvals. It has plans to hunt for opportunities for acquisitions.

The FMCG major Britannia Industries has reported a 19.41 per cent jump in consolidated net profit at Rs 258.08 crore for the June quarter, driven by double-digit volume growth.

Net profit stood at Rs 216.12 crore in April-June a year ago.

Global brokerages, including UBS and Goldman Sachs, have ‘Buy’ rating on Britannia shares with a target price of Rs 7,700 and Rs 7,235, respectively. UBS believes that Britannia is the key beneficiary of rural upswing, and diversification is on track. “Maintain buy on good revenue and earnings growth visibility compared with peers,” said UBS.

Goldman Sachs believes Britannia has re-invested gross margin benefit in ad spend to support volume growth. It maintained a bullish stance on the ability to drive premiumisation by launching affordable packs of premium products"
19,2018-08-21,Nestle,"NEW YORK: CEOs who are paid less than their peers are four times more likely to engage in layoffs, a study has found. Researchers from Binghamton University in the US analysed data that included CEO pay and layoff announcements made by S&P 500 firms from 1992-2014 in the financial services, consumer staples and IT industries. 

Adjusting the analysis for a number of different factors that could influence a layoff -- such as industry conditions, company size, firm performance -- researchers found that the ""underpaid"" CEOs were four times more likely to announce a layoff. 

""In terms of strategic decisions that a CEO can make that could lead to higher pay, layoffs are one of the easiest to do,"" said Scott Bentley, an assistant professor at Binghamton University. 

 ""Relative to other decisions such as mergers or acquisitions, layoffs typically don't need the approval of shareholders, the board or regulators, and they don't take years to do. Layoffs can be determined overnight,"" said Bentley.

""In a way, CEOs are just like any other type of employee. They are going to compare their pay to those around them,"" Bentley said. 

 ""The difference is that the average employee can't make strategic decisions for the company that influences their own pay. Executives can,"" he said. 

The relationship between lower pay and the likelihood of layoffs all but disappears when a CEO is paid more than his or her peers, researchers said. 



""Right around the point where CEOs are paid equal to their peers, the effect kind of goes away. We found that there's this huge dropoff in the likelihood of announcing layoffs once your pay is relatively the same as, or more than, your peers,"" Bentley said. 

 On average, researchers found CEO pay generally increased in the year following a layoff when firm performance also improved. 

""While there are some instances where pay increased when performance decreased, we found that if the company and the shareholders don't benefit from the layoffs, neither does the CEO in most cases,"" Bentley said.

In a late evening meeting yesterday with the representatives of leading food processing companies, Badal discussed a plan to strategise assistance to Kerala in the coming days.

""It is time to work as a cohesive unit and make a coordinated effort to help the people of Kerala, instead of separate entities making individual efforts,"" said the minister of food processing industries.

The companies have pledged full support to the endeavour of reaching out to the people hit by the floods, she said in a statement.

Hindustan Unilever said it has already supplied 9,500 cases of salt, 29,000 cases of wheat products, 1,000 cases of Ketchup, 250 cases of spices mix masala and other products across the state.

17,2018-08-21,Nestle,"MUMBAI | NEW DELHI: Breakfast cereal maker Kellogg and UK healthcare giant Reckitt Benckiser Plc are the latest entrants in the race to acquire the consumer nutrition business of GlaxoSmithKline, joining Nestle, Unilever, Mondelez and Coca-Cola in the near $4.5-billion takeover pursuit, said several people with knowledge of the matter.

While Kellogg’s entry is regarded as a surprise, being ultra-conservative in India even after a presence of more than two decades, Reckitt Benckiser has been growing inorganically across the world under CEO Rakesh Kapoor. Its last big acquisition in India was Paras Pharmaceuticals eight years ago. Last year, Kapoor steered the $18-billion acquisition of US infant formula business Mead Johnson, its largest purchase.

Both companies have completed initial evaluations. Kellogg is being advised by Rothschild, and Reckitt, maker of Dettol soap and Air Wick air freshener, has roped in Goldman Sachs, said the people cited above.

Reckitt and Kellogg declined to comment. For British healthcare giant Reckitt Benckiser, seen as a strong contender for GSK Consumer, inorganic growth has been a strategy that has mostly worked well. The Mead Johnson baby milk business helped it halt a string of disappointing results. Last month it posted higher-than-expected earnings that saw sales grow 4% on the back of its health and hygiene business. UBS analyst Pinar Ergun feels the July quarter marked the end of a long downgrade cycle.

“The Mead Johnson acquisition has taken RB into a global market leadership in consumer health and foods,” Reckitt has said. “Mead Johnson’s geographic footprint significantly strengthens our position in developing markets, which account for approximately 40% of the combined group’s sales.”




If the Horlicks deal does materialise, Reckitt Benckiser is likely to push it into chemist channels and pharmacies instead of traditional grocery, and reformulate the brand beyond just a milk-based beverage, said an executive aware of the development. Also, there are product synergies between Reckitt Benckiser and GSK’s over-the-counter (OTC) products such as Crocin, Sensodyne and Eno.

BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS

With its India sales at Rs 800 crore after 24 years in the country, Kellogg’s $14-billion parent has been pushing inorganic growth, especially in emerging markets to take its portfolio beyond breakfast to overall snacks. The potential acquisition of Horlicks will be a global move driven by its Michigan-based parent, people aware of the development said.

“Kellogg India doesn’t have the resources to push such a mega deal,” said a top industry executive, closely associated with the company.

“Besides, historically, it hasn’t been aggressive in India, and neither has it explored acquisitions, instead, basing its strategy only on localisation, pushing small packs and moving beyond breakfast to cereal-based snacking, which is witnessing intensified competition.”

Kellogg India contributes 10% to Asia-Pacific revenue and leads the Indian breakfast space with an estimated share of over 60%, but deep-pocketed rivals are looking to challenging that. Last month, Nestle announced its foray into the Rs 980-crore breakfast cereal category with Nesplus. Others such as PepsiCo, ITC Foods, Britannia and MTR have been pushing ready-to-cook products in the space. Kellogg India’s new managing director Mohit Anand, formerly of Unilever, has the mandate to push growth aggressively.

The maker of cornflakes, Honey Loops, Special K, Chocos, oats and muesli, has been pushing localisation and on-the-go consumption, penetrating small towns and markets with smaller packs of cereal at fast-moving price points of Rs 10 and Rs 5. It’s also been looking to broadbase distribution outreach to channels besides grocery stores. The Horlicks deal, if it goes through, will be its first acquisition in India.

With consumer trends moving away from breakfast cereal in mature markets that are perceived to be sugary and having artificial ingredients, the cereal maker has been diversifying into healthier foods inorganically.

Globally, Kellogg has been shopping for strategic brands and businesses. Its inorganic M&As include a stake acquisition in packaged food maker Tolaram Africa Foods (TAF) in May this year.

TAF is one of the largest manufacturers and distributors of noodle products in Ghana and Nigeria. In 2016, it acquired Brazilian Parati Group which makes biscuits, and powdered beverage and pasta brands. It acquired Egyptian biscuit company Bisco Misr in 2015. Before that, it bought Pringles salty snacks in 2012. None of the brands has been brought to India.

While the health food drinks category has been growing only in single digits, GSK Consumer’s Horlicks and Boost are strong brands that can be leveraged into other categories in the health space. Kellogg could use it to enter biscuits, nutribars and crackers, for instance.

“A buy into Horlicks will not only give it instant shelf space in the healthbeverage category, but also help it expand into other categories such as biscuits, a space where it has had an initial failed attempt,” said a senior executive formerly associated with Kellogg. It made a shortlived foray into biscuits in India in the 1990s.

The Horlicks and Boost brands command approximately 70% of overall value share in Indian malted food drinks (MFD) market.

They had a combined revenue of £550 million in 2017, with India contributing most of it. In March, the company decided to review and potentially sell the nutrition products business to fund the $13 billion buyout of Novartis’ stake in a consumer healthcare joint venture.

The review will also include an assessment of the parent’s 72.5% stake in GSK Consumer in India. The current market cap of the company is Rs 28,522.91crore.

The outcome of the review is likely by end-2018. Morgan Stanley and Greenhill are advising GSK."

25,2018-08-23,Nestle,"Oil, coupled with political uncertainty, will keep market on tenterhooks, Vikas Khemani, President & CEO, Edelweiss Securities, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:


Why are markets fluctuating from one extreme end to the other? It was outright despair, panic, gloom and doom in July or end of June. Now it is back to euphoric levels! Everyone is of the view that the summer correction has come and gone and optimism is certainly back. 

Definitely markets are at all-time high. But the optimism which was there in the beginning of the year, is nowhere there, even if markets have hit new highs. The very simple reason for that is that we are seeing this headline index doing very well because of a) sectoral rotation. Last year’s laggards– IT and pharma -- are reasonably good weight now. In last five-six months, we have seen these two sectors participating and contributing a fairly large portion of the Nifty gain. That is the reason it is looking very good. Many of them are below 200 DMA. Participation is slightly narrow, restricted to some of the largecaps and a few sectors. But this rotation is at play. 

Also, it clearly shows that the worry on the currency front, which is helping some of these sectors move towards defensive side -- both in IT and pharma -- kind of explains the nature of the market. 

b) Another positive is corporate earnings have started picking up. By and large, we have seen a fairly good robust corporate earnings. As we move forward, it looks like things are going to be reasonably okay. After long, we have started seeing that. 

Domestic liquidity has been reasonably alright. It has not disappointed. At some point in time, the market expected domestic liquidity to disappoint. It has been very good and robust and that has added to the mood of the market. As we pan out, we have some more uncertainties going on especially around the oil embargo and trade wars. 

If the Iran sanction gets implemented, India has to watch because oil is the single biggest risk for India. If oil continues to remain strong and strengthens further, then we will have another problem to deal with. So oil, coupled with some of the political uncertainty, will keep the market on tenterhooks. Otherwise, by and large, the defensives will continue to participate in the market.


The election predictions have already begun. One of the global brokerages believes that it is going to be a coalition BJP win. Modi is not going to come solo. CLSA believes that the markets has already begun to price in that event. Do you believe that market men are taking tactical positions keeping the elections at the back of their mind?
In politics, one year is a very long period of time to predict anything. Things can change very rapidly. If you were chatting or sensing the mood of the market only three-four months ago, it was looking pretty bleak. I have continued to believe for a long, long time that we will get BJP government back and I do not see any significant or even a drop in the strength of the BJP from what it is at present. There could be little bit here and there but I do not think any drop would happen. 

For next one year, I am reasonably sure that – a) economic mood has started changing and business mood will follow. We will start seeing a fairly robust rural demand. The noise that you have been hearing, will start converting into positive noise which will help BJP to come back to power. 

I do not believe that BJP will lose strength in the coming elections. By and large it will continue and Indian economy needs continuity of the current policies and current government, which I think is good. So as that gets clear, you might see the market starting to factor that in, like in 2014, when much before the election, market started factoring in reasonably good amount of victory. 

So that trend might come true and if that happens, market will continue to rally because economy is doing well and political uncertainty waning away will add to the strength of the market.


Where can one still generate that alpha in the market? Some of the themes that you are propagating still have to do with the consumption space. Do you think now the conviction with the investment led themes gets louder or because of this political overhang, should one step back on that?
 Themes do not change.

In fact, the consumption theme definitely remains very strong, especially when the government has reduced the GST rates and tax collections have been fairly buoyant.

I believe that probably the government will continue to work on a path to reduce the tax rate further. If that happens, it will only boost consumption. We recently saw that in case of some of the white goods. The consumption theme in my opinion will continue to remain very strong over many years to come, including the year which we are in. 

I think we have just begun the investment cycle, it does not change very often we have seen huge amount of investments being planned and it keeps on getting added.

You would have seen recently a lot of city gas licenses were given and the collective investments which will happen over the next five, seven years is almost Rs 2-2.5 lakh crore. As investments gain momentum, we get into a multi-year, fairly long investment cycle. While public side investment has been around for some time, even private capex is picking up. I believe that India will be fairly balanced both on investment as well as the consumption cycle. 

One of the interesting things which gives comfort to most of us is that even on export side, we are beginning to see where the currency is going and what is happening in China, a good uptick on the exports side. 

Over the next four, five years, we are going to see a fairly balanced all-round growth of investment, consumption and export. It is a very good situation to be in from any economic perspective.


Nestle is at 55 times, HUL is at 50 times, others may be at 45 or 50 times. Is there a case that consumption businesses will grow but consumption stocks will not give you a return? It is like saying that the need for healthcare, pharma and consumption will always remain in India. These are great evergreen themes but some of the names may not be good stocks to buy because the investor looks for returns and returns may not come in?
It is a very fairly valid point. That is why stock picking has to be done very carefully. Some of the large expensive names do not give return because they have to be de-rated and derating typically happens when growth wanes or some sort of competition comes in or margins contract. 

It looks like currently the way we are going to be in a strong demand environment and if that continues, it is unlikely that they would have either less growth or compression of the margins. But anything can change. 

The point I am making is that de-rating might be the reason why investors are ready to pay higher valuation because the comfort is there for at least four, five years. Post that, derating can happen and hence it is good to own for the next three, four years. 

But having said that, I do agree with you that some of the names have been fairly expensive and one has to be very careful and evaluate risk reward of investing into them.


The sectoral churn I guess has already played out. Newer sectors actually contributing to Nifty, pharma clearly being one such case in point. The rally which began with largecap pharmaceuticals is now spreading to the smaller ones as well. Divi’s Labs is a case in point. Would you propagate a basket buying case for pharma or would it be better to be selective?
The pharma sector has been coming out of a long period of disappointments and regulatory backlash as well as price cut in international market and domestic markets. 

Two things are helping: a) Price erosions have receded and some of price hikes have started happening in the developed markets. b) Currency which is almost down 7-8%, is adding to the margin and to that extent these stocks have been benefiting a lot. Domestic markets are also beginning to see a good growth coming up and some of the recent government plan on the Ayush and giving healthcare for all this only can accelerate. 

It seems that stars are getting aligned for pharmaceutical industry which has been sort of adverse for many years in the recent past.

It is beginning and it is kind of similar to what we saw for IT about a year back. Suddenly IT stocks have started coming back. The demand environment has started improving, currency ha started helping, You will see similar kind of trend happening in pharmaceutical again. 

When you are positive on a sector, you cannot say buy everything. You have to do your bottom-up checking. But, pharma is a very limited basket and so we have been reasonably positive on all the big names including Dr Reddy’s and Lupin. 


Retail as a theme has suddenly popped up on the screen on account of the interest that is coming in. Do you think we will have a further build up in retail companies, the way we saw with what happened post D-Mart’s listing?
Retail as a theme has been picking up. Especially in the recent past, most of the retailers have started doing that but especially the value retailers have been able to generate good return on the capital. These stocks have been in limelight whether it is D-Mart or V-Mart and in fact Future Group which historically has been struggling with the ROCs, of late, has started picking up with good returns. The environment seems to be settling down and discounting seems to be going down.

Demand was never a problem and demand will never be problem in a country like India on the retailing side. That is the we are seeing some of these stocks have started doing well and we remain positive on most of these names which have been doing well in the retail segment.


Do you think from here to election, next 8-10 months, one should not expect even double digit returns for the index as there would be an element of uncertainty and markets also are no longer cheap ?
It is very hard to say. The markets always tend to perform on the basis of expectation. There are two big events which are going to keep markets uncertain. One, will be around Iran sanctions and how they pan out because that is very critical event for India purely from a oil price perspective. If that gets implemented, there is a good probability that oil might inch towards 90 to 100. If that were to happen, it is pretty negative for India, India inflation, interest rates and everything else. 

So, nobody can predict what is going to happen and November 4, we will get to see the final outcome. Till then, you will have this kind of uncertainty to live with and any implication of that is fairly binary or severe.

Two, the political event of election. It will again really depend on what kind of mood builds, what kind of sentiment builds, what kind of expectation gets built in. If the expectation start getting build in that BJP is coming back to the power with decent sort of numbers, market will start factoring in that well in advance even ahead of the results. 

But if the mood spells differently, then also market will reflect that.

So the implication of both these events could be very severe as well."
26,2018-08-23,Nestle,"NEW DELHI: Ending Thursday’s rangebound session, equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty settled at fresh record highs of 38,336 and 11,582, respectively, on gains in energy, IT, auto and power stocks.

Trade dispute intensifiesThe world’s two largest economies escalated trade tussle on Thursday, after the US imposed 25 per cent tariffs on another $16 billion worth of Chinese goods. In retaliation, China imposed 25 per cent tariffs on an equal amount of American goods. This happened as officials from the two countries met in Washington to find a way out for the trade tension.


Rupee’s unabated slideIndian currency suffered on Thursday, once again breaching the 70-mark against the US dollar. Experts say increased demand for the US currency along with its rise against other currencies on expectations of rising US interest rates put pressure on the domestic unit. At the time of writing of this report, the rupee traded 27 paise down at 70.10.


CreditAccess Grameen's tepid debutShares of CreditAccess Grameen made a tepid debut on BSE, as the scrip got listed at Rs 385, an 8.77 per cent discount to its issue price of Rs 422. The Rs 1,131 crore initial public offer (IPO) of the microfinance firm, sold from August 8 to 10, had been subscribed over 2 times. The scrip closed the day 0.28 per cent down from issue price. 


RIL reaches another milestoneReliance Industries, which is in a neck-and-neck fight with TCS in terms of market capitalisation (m-cap) race, became the first listed Indian company to hit Rs 8 lakh crore market valuation.

RIL shares hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 1,273, before settling at Rs 1,269, up just 1.86 per cent. 


L&T led Sensex packLeading brokerages came out with bullish views on the engineering and construction major, after the company’s board approved buyback of shares worth Rs 9,000 crore, which will mean the acquisition of 4.29 per cent equity. The board fixed the buyback price at Rs 1,500, 13 per cent above last closing price. The stock led the pack of Sensex gainers and settled 2.30 per cent higher at Rs 1,352.


Metals meltedMost metal & mining stocks came under strong pressure after the US imposed an anti-dumping duty of 50 per cent on Indian metal pipes.

MACD’s bullish signal on RIL, TCS Momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, signalled upward crossovers for 33 stocks on NSE, meaning the possibility of more upside on these counters. Among the stocks with upward crossovers were Reliance Industries (RIL), Tata Consultancy Services, UPL and Prataap Snacks. However, Vedanta, IDBI Bank, Motherson Sumi Systems, Titan Company and Ceat were among the 45 stocks that saw bearish crossovers on NSE, giving a ‘sell’ signal."
20,2018-08-23,Nestle,"Motilal Oswal Securities has a neutral call on Nestle India with a target price of Rs 10,620.

The current market price of Nestle India is Rs 10,887.80. 

Time period given by the brokerage is one year when Nestle India price can reach the defined target. 


Valuation and view of the brokerage on the company:
Among the various points discussed in the analyst meet, we were particularly enthused by the volumes outperformance of 200bp (not shared in interim results) versus our estimate, which consequently prompted us to raise our sales and PAT forecasts for FY19. At the same time, we also note that the current-year margins have been largely propped by extremely muted material costs.

While the sales prospects appear promising for CY18 and CY20 (highest for NEST since CY11), the risks on the margins front are high, particularly after the windfall gross margin gains in 1HCY18. This is mainly because material costs have started trending up and management has stated its intention of protecting growth even if it means lower price increases than in the past in response to material cost movement.

While NEST is on a much stronger footing than any time in the current decade, valuations of 48.8x CY20E EPS fairly capture these prospects, in our view. We, thus, maintain our Neutral rating with a target price of Rs 10,620 (49x Sep’20E EPS)."
22,2018-08-23,Nestle,"NEW DELHI: FMCG major Nestle India surged 4 per cent on early 
Thursday. 

The company in a BSE filing 
on Wednesday said it has partnered with Flipkart to launch Maggi Special Masala noodles.

At 
10:05 am, the stock was 3.60 per cent higher at Rs 11,280 on the BSE. 

Under the partnership, from August 21, consumers can pre-book Maggi Special Masala Noodles on Flipkart. The product will be available exclusively on Flipkart on 
August 25-30, following which it will be available nationwide through Nestle's strong distribution reach, the company said in a release. 

Maarten Geraets, General Manager, Foods, Nestle India, said, ""We are excited about our partnership with Flipkart as it will give a chance to Maggi lovers to try this innovation from the convenience of their home.""

Nishit Garg, Senior Director, Flipkart, said, ""Nestle and Flipkart's association to launch the upcoming Maggi flavor exclusively on Flipkart cements the transition of FMCG's physical goods into the digital space. Having travelled through several generations, Maggi proudly enjoys an enduring relationship with its customers. And we are very excited to partner through this journey of delighting our customers, now online."" 

The FMCG firm had reported 49.95 per cent jump in net profit at Rs 395.03 crore for the second quarter to June, helped by lower expenses.

The company, which follows January-December financial year, had posted a net profit of Rs 263.43 crore for April-June of 2017-18."
27,2018-08-24,Nestle,"In pharma, the rally is spreading to midcaps and Abhimanyu Sofat, VP- Research, IIFL, would prefer to be stock specific in this sector. Sofat tells ET Now he is 
  
  
  bullish on Swaraj Engine. Edited excerpts:

There was a 14% upmove in the Sun Pharma stock in the month gone by. Today, they have got an USFDA nod for two drugs with a size of about $180 million. Is there still value on the table for not just Sun Pharma but for any other pharmaceutical names as well? The rally is spreading its wings in midcap pharma names like Divi’s Labs which saw a big move in the previous two days?
We would be stock specific in the pharmaceutical sector. The undercurrent of weakness in the generic market in US is still there. Within the sector, we would prefer something like Aurobindo Pharma which is trading at around PE multiple of around 12.5 which has a large pipeline of ANDA approvals. 

With regards to Sun, even after one takes into consideration the upside from Halol and the positive news flow, we do feel that going forward, the margin of improvement is going to be a key pressure point for the company, considering that their entering into more specialty segment will entail a lot of investments.

As of now, we are more bullish on companies like Aurobindo, Cipla and Torrent rather than looking at companies like Sun, Lupin etc.


DRL has got necessary approvals for Srikakulam plant. Yesterday they got an EIR.
In case of DRL, our view is similar to the case of Sun Pharma. We do not believe that the issues which the sector is going through are completely done with. Right now, we would be focussing more on companies like Cipla as well as Aurobindo, rather than looking at stocks like DRL. 

We already saw that they had lot of pressure earlier from the Russian market and we have seen a lot of FDA issues getting sorted. Right now, we would like to maintain a cautious stance on this particular company. 

With regards to Nestle, our view is that the valuations may be a bit higher but it is still not as high as something like HUL which is currently trading at close to around 52 times. Nestle is trading at around 46 times FY20. In Maggi, they have stabilised their market share at close to around 60%. Before the fiasco happened, their market share was close to 70%. Even segments like pasta, they are at number one. 

Overall, having that leadership approach, will ensure that the stock will continue to be at a premium valuation and considering earnings growth of around 25% going forward, valuation will sustain with some upside of close to around 15% from current levels.


What are you recommending when it comes to IT majors in lieu of the currency position?
We are right now quite bullish on Tech Mahindra, considering that we see going forward a rebound happening in the telecom space. because of new investment happening on 5G as well as among their key clients because of consolidation, some work could start after two-three quarters. On the enterprise side as well, the growth is quite decent. Overall, with the double digit kind of a growth and earnings growth of close to around 16%, Tech Mahindra looks quite interesting to us.

Even on the larger cap side, Infosys is trading at a discount to TCS. Right now, that discount is close to around 30%. I think that gap can reduce going forward. 

There are tailwinds in IT sector. In addition, the improvement that we are seeing in the BFSI space in US is likely to lead to further upside in the sector. We will continue to be overweight on the sector going forward as well.


One midcap idea from you?
One mid to smallcap idea that one can look at is Swaraj Engine which is a supplier of engines to M&M. Currently the market share is close to around 30% and going forward, we expect considering that rural economy is doing well and 90% of the business comes to Swaraj Engines. 

Going forward, growth number is going to be pretty robust and PAT growth close to around 25%. In terms of valuations, the stock is quite attractive at around 16.5 PE considering that the ROE is beyond 30%. From a risk-reward perspective, considering that it is a zero-debt company with a significantly high dividend payout, that is one stock that one can look at for a minimum 20% upside in next one year."
28,2018-08-28,Nestle,"Investors on Dalal Street became richer by nearly Rs 15 lakh crore in just 40 trading session, as sustained buying in largecap stocks as well as fund inflows by domestic institutional investors supported market sentiment.

The total market capitalisation of all the BSE-listed firms soared to around Rs 159 lakh crore on August 28 from Rs 144 lakh crore on July 2. However, falling rupee, US-China trade war concern and weakness in emerging market currencies kept market participants cautious.

Benchmark equity index BSE Sensex closed at a fresh record high on Tuesday, while the NSE Nifty index ended above the 11,700-mark for the first time ever.

On further movement of the equity market, Arun Thukral, MD & CEO of Axis Securities in an interaction with ETNow said, “Nifty is inching towards 12,000 and medium to long-term, we are very bullish on the market and as well as the economy. But yes, there will be short-term jerks coming in betw een. We are advising our investors to keep pumping money on all these jerks and triggers.”

In terms of wealth creators, oil-to-telecom behemoth Reliance Industries added over Rs 2.25 lakh crore to its market capitalisation during the period. Share price of the company jumped 37 per cent to Rs 1,318.20 on August 28 from Rs 961.10 on July 2. 

Still, brokerage Kotak Institutional Equities has reiterated ‘Sell’ rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 985. 

“Our reverse valuation exercise suggests that investors have not only priced in a robust energy segment performance in RIL’s current valuations, but also ascribed the enterprise value (EV) of leading players in key sectors that are being targeted by RIL’s platform narrative—Bharti’s India business (telecom), Avenue Supermarts (retail), Flipkart (e-commerce) and key players in the media sector (content ecosystem),” Kotak said in a report.

Tata Consultancy Services has added Rs 80,381 crore to its market cap since July 2. ITC (Rs 59,890 crore), State Bank of India (Rs 40,919 crore), ICICI Bank (Rs 39,591 crore), Axis Bank (Rs 38,027 crore), Bajaj Finance (Rs 36,788 crore) were among other top grossers in terms of m-cap.

In terms of share price, companies such as Adani Power, Adani Green Energy, SORIL Infra Resources, Adani Enterprises more than doubled investors wealth during July 2-August 28. 

Other names including Atlas Jewellery Sharp India, Tiaan Ayurvedic & Herbs, Alora Trading Company, Sawaca Business Machines, Birla Cable, Danube Industries, Sport King India, SPL Industries, Gangotri Textiles, Zenlabs Ethica, Diamines & Chemicals and MM Rubber rallied 100-191 per cent.

All the sectoral indices on the BSE moved northwards since July 2 with FMCG index rallying 13 per cent, followed by Oil & Gas (up 11 per cent), Healthcare (up 11 per cent), Power (up 10 per cent), Bankex (up 9 per cent), IT (9 per cent). 

Hemang Jani, Head - Advisory, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas, said, “On the earnings front Q1FY19 numbers have been above expectations and we remain confident that rural demand will pick up in the coming quarters. With government focusing on cleaning up the banking sector there may some short-term pressure on banking names, but the worst is behind.”

Jani prefers stocks in the private banking space and feel that they will outperform their PSU peers. Stocks such as HDFC Bank and RBL Bank remain among preferred picks. He also believes that market will continue to be volatile in the short term on the back of global fund inflows and general elections in 2019. “Any correction should be used by investors to add quality companies,” Jani said.

Capital Goods, Teck, Consumer durables, Metal, Auto and Realty index also rallied up to 8 per cent during the past 40 trading sessions.

Foreign portfolio investors have poured over Rs 4,000 crore in domestic equity markets since July this year. However, they offloaded shares worth Rs 6,000 during the first half of 2018. On the other hand, net investment of domestic institutional investors stood over Rs 71,000 crore on YtD basis.

For investment perspective, global brokerage CLSA has recommended few largecap stocks for investors. The financial services firm sees value in HDFC (target price: Rs 2,480), IndusInd Bank (Rs 1975.95), Infosys (Rs 1,560), ITC (Rs 390), Mahindra & Mahindra (Rs 1,120), Maruti Suzuki (Rs 11,300) and Sun Pharma (Rs 750)."

30,2018-08-30,Nestle,"The company that brought you milk chocolate, Maggi instant noodles and Rocky Road ice cream is worried about your health.

Nestle SA, the world’s largest food company, has joined the trend for personalized nutrition with a blend of artificial intelligence, DNA testing and the modern obsession with Instagramming food. The program, begun in aging Japan, could provide the Swiss company with a wealth of data about customers’ wellness and diet as it pivots toward consumers who are seeking to improve their health and longevity.

In Japan, some 100,000 users of the “Nestle Wellness Ambassador” program send pictures of their food via the popular Line app that then recommends lifestyle changes and specially formulated supplements. The program can cost $600 a year for capsules that make nutrient-rich teas, smoothies and other products such as vitamin-fortified snacks. A home kit to provide samples for blood and DNA testing helps identify susceptibility to common ailments like high cholesterol or diabetes.

“Most of the personalized approach is driven by smaller companies, that’s why it was fairly limited,” said Ray Fujii, a partner at L.E.K. Consulting in Japan. “Nestle is taking a further step. They’re trying to figure out the algorithm between the test results and the genetic information and what they recommend as a solution. If they could do it, it’s a very big step.”


Snacks to Supplements
Nestle’s program is part of a change in direction for the 152-year-old company, which sold off its U.S. candy unit this year amid falling demand for sugary treats. Nestle has made a spate of investments targeted at healthier options including vegetarian meal maker Sweet Earth Foods and meal-delivery service Freshly. The company bought Canadian dietary supplements maker Atrium Innovations in March for $2.3 billion, its biggest medical-nutrition purchase in more than a decade.

“Health problems associated with food and nutrition have become a big issue,” said Kozo Takaoka, head of the company’s business in Japan, in an interview in Tokyo. “Nestle must address that on a global basis and make it our mission for the 21st century.” He said the wellness segment could eventually account for half of Nestle’s sales in Japan.


Bloomberg

The investments come with the burgeoning interest in so-called nutraceuticals -- food-derived ingredients that are processed and packaged as medicine or wellness aids -- among consumers that are increasingly skeptical about mass products. Nestle employs more than a hundred scientists in areas including cell biology, gastrointestinal medicine and genomics at the Nestle Institute of Health Sciences and has been developing tools to analyze and measure people’s nutrient levels.

“Decades in the future, all companies will probably have to be doing it,” said Jon Cox, an analyst at Kepler Cheuvreux. “The industry has probably had a setback as consumers also want natural and less processed products while adding supplements is seen as artificial or creating Frankenstein food.”

Some nutritionists are skeptical that tailored diet plans based around supplements are useful and that they may have more of a psychological effect than a medical one.

“Nestle’s program is designed to personalize diets in ways unlikely to be necessary,” said Marion Nestle, a nutrition professor at New York University who isn’t linked to the KitKat maker. “If we think something will make us healthier, we are likely to feel healthier.”


Genetics and AI
One of the early adopters among the food companies was Campbell Soup Co., which invested $32 million in 2016 in San Francisco-based startup Habit, which uses DNA and blood profiles to make diet recommendations, as well as offering nutritional coaching and tailored meal-kits.

Big Food is tapping expertise in AI and genetics to navigate a sea change in the way consumers make choices, which has upended businesses from transportation to television.

“In the 21st century, innovation is using the internet and AI to solve problems that our customers didn’t realize they had, or problems they had given up on,” said Takaoka, who is famous in Japan for making the KitKat chocolate wafer an iconic local snack by adding green tea and other flavors.

He said big consumer companies can no longer rely on the power of their brands to woo a generation that grew up with e-commerce.

“They just search for things, they don’t pick the brand,” he said. “When people talk about brand marketing, I’m just thinking ‘what’s that?’”


Kale Smoothies
Hitomi Kasuda, a 47-year-old freelance writer, says drinking Nestle’s kale smoothie and other health drinks as much as four times a week helps her feel better about not eating enough vegetables. She gave up using the chat function on the app, but said she’s keen to get the DNA test.

“There’s probably a lot of things I don’t realize about my health that I can discover in a blood and genetics test,” said Kasuda, who lives south of Tokyo in Yokohama. “Even if I feel healthy, I’d like to know more about the quality of my health.”

In his 2016 book “Nutrition for a Better Life,” former Nestle chief Peter Brabeck-Letmathe proposed that personalized diet and health programs were the future of nutrition. “Using a capsule similar to a Nespresso, people will be able to take individual nutrient cocktails or prepare their food via 3-D printers according to electronically recorded health recommendations,” he wrote.

Two years later, Japanese subscribers in the wellness program now drink nutrient-fortified teas dispensed in capsules using a product similar to Nespresso, Nestle’s trademark coffee machine.

“We’re getting consumer buy-in because we live in a hedonistic, me-first kind of world,” said Peter Jones, a nutritional scientist at the University of Manitoba in Canada. “This is going to be the manifestation of the future. The one-size-fits-all platform is a thing of the past.”"
32,2018-08-31,Nestle,"NEW DELHI: Indian equity benchmark Sensex extended its loss to the third consecutive session on Friday, while Nifty50 managed to settle with nominal gain. Other Asian markets also saw losses as worries of a trade war between the US and China intensified after the President Donald Trump indicated a new set of tariffs on Chinese goods. 

Trump’s comment that the US was preparing to impose tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods and his threat to pull the US out of the World Trade Organisation spooked markets across the globe.

Investors held their moves, awaiting June quarter GDP data and other macro numbers, including July fiscal deficit and infrastructure output data. 

Rupee’s health deteriorated further as it touched a fresh record low at 71 against the greenback. At the time of writing of this report, the rupee was trading 21 paise lower at 70.94. 

The BSE Sensex ended the day at 38,645 with a loss of 45 points, or 0.12 per cent, while the Nifty50 finished at 11,680, up 4 points or 0.03 per cent. For the week, both Sensex and Nifty rose by 1 per cent.

Let’s walk you through the key highlights of Friday’s trade


Who moved my SensexReliance Industries continued to be the top drag on the 30-share index for the third straight day. YES Bank, with a loss of 5.11 per cent, emerged as the top loser in the index. This was YES Bank’s fourth consecutive fall. The bank stock plunged on Friday after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) allowed CEO Rana Kapoor to continue in his present position till further notice. Analysts said RBI kept the Street guessing on Kapoor’s appointment and the announcement came just a day before his current three-year term was to end. Investors reacted negatively to this uncertainty. 


Rupee refused to recoverRupee touched the 71-mark for the first time. Higher crude oil prices and sustained demand for the US dollar have been adding the rupee’s fall. Trade deficit – mostly because of a spike in oil prices – has been a major reason behind rupee's fall. A widening trade deficit is dragging the rupee down as more imports require India to buy more foreign currencies. 


IT, pharma capitalise on rupee's fallTwo major export-oriented sectors IT and pharma clocked decent gains on Friday on account of a fresh fall in rupee. Since a major part of their sales revenue comes in the US dollar, a fall in rupee means more rupee for them in simple terms. Mindtree (5.92 per cent), Abbott India (up 4.89 per cent), Tech Mahindra (up 4.80 per cent), Merck (up 4.03 per cent), Sun Pharma (up 1.99 per cent), Infosys (1.59 per cent) and Divi's Laboratories (up 0.54 per cent) hit fresh 52-week highs. Dr Reddy's Laboratories (up 4.67 per cent), Lupin (up 4.35 per cent), Cadila Healthcare (up 3.73 per cent) and HCL Technologies (up 2.93 per cent) clocked decent gains. 


Spurt in open interest Page Industries witnessed the biggest spike in open interest at 157.86 per cent, followed by YES Bank (66.71 per cent), Mindtree (37.48 per cent), Adani Enterprises (32.05 per cent) and NIIT Technologies (31.43 per cent)


52-week highs and lowsAs many as 58 stocks, including Vardhman Textiles, TD Power Systems, Simplex Infrastructures and S Chand And Company, hit 52-week lows on Friday. On the other hand, 46 stocks, including Infosys, ITC, Nestle India, Sun Pharma, Tech Mahindra, Divi's Laboratories and Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, hit 52-week highs on NSE.

The market opened in the green, riding the optimism of strong GDP number and a rise in the rupee against the US dollar. However, weak gl obal cues weighed on the sentiments and a fresh bout of profit booking hurt major counters. 

Major global markets extended their fall as simmering trade tension kept investors depressed.

1,2018-09-03,Nestle,"KOLKATA: If you join an MBA course at any of India’s top business schools, chances are you may land a job a little more than a year into the programme.

Companies are increasingly giving pre-placement offers (PPOs) to students of top B-schools based on their performance during summer internships. At this rate, the 30-minute final placement interview — the traditional method of campus recruitment — may soon become the second most-preferred way for hiring future managers.

Estimates from several Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) and other top B-schools such as MDI Gurgaon and XLRI show that up to one in every three students in the class of 2020 is likely to be recruited through PPOs.

Consulting and consumer biggies are leading the charge with a flurry of preplacement offers, in the process ensuring that more students have a job in hand before the final placements even kick off in what institutes expect to be a strong placement season.

Pre-placement offers usually go on till January. This year, just a couple of months into the process—and more than four to go—most IIMs have already notched up 60-80% of last year’s total PPO tally.

IIM Bangalore has already received over 100 PPOs this year, against a total of 155 PPOs the previous batch managed to attract by the end of the academic year. IIM Calcutta has 80-plus PPOs (last year’s total was 133) while IIM Kozhikode has so far got at least 61offers against 79 in the whole of last year.



At MDI Gurgaon, the PPO tally has crossed 71, a nearly 122% jump over the 32 offers it had at the same time last year. XLRI-Xavier School of Management students have notched up over 81 offers against last year’s total of 122.

CONSULTING, CONSUMER COS LEAD WAY
Sapna Agrawal, head, career development services, IIM Bangalore, said strategy consulting, general management and FMCG companies are normally early with their pre-placement offers. “The finance firms will confirm their PPOs later,” she said.

Global management consultancy BCG India has already made 50-plus pre-placement offers across the country’s top B-schools. “Over the last few years, our internship numbers have increased dramatically given our overall strong growth and intent to shift towards sizeable PPO hires,” said Sumit Gupta, partner & recruiting head at BCG India. Hiring through PPOs is aimed at giving both the parties a chance to experience each other and bring out the best results, he said.

Bain & Company, too, will continue to double down on PPOs across experienced consultant roles, its partner Megha Chawla said. The global consulting firm runs its summer programme at IIM Ahmedabad, IIM Bangalore, IIM Calcutta and IIM Lucknow. “It’s an indispensable part of our recruitment process,” Chawla said, adding that about 75% is the typical conversion rate of interns landing pre-placement offers.

Consumer companies too are going strong. Hindustan Unilever, Procter & Gamble, and Reckitt Benckiser are among consumer products companies that have made PPOs at IIM Calcutta, said Abhishek Goel, chairperson, career development and placement office, at the institute.

At IIM Kozhikode, Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail, Asian Paints, BCG, Deloitte, EY, HUL and Nestle were among those who have made offers, its placements chairperson Shovan Chowdhury said.

Godrej offers internships and hires full time for all its key businesses in human resources, supply chain, sales, marketing, strategy and business development. This time, it has made 26 PPOs from summer internships for students graduating in 2019. Besides scaling up hiring from regulars such as IIFT, MDI, FMS, IIM Ahmedabad, ISB, SPJIMR, NITIE, SIBM, SCMHRD, IRMA and XIMB, it has also explored some new schools like IIM Trichy for the Godrej Agrovet business, and IIM Calcutta, for Godrej Properties.

Sumit Mitra, head-group HR and corporate services at Godrej Industries and associate companies, said 37 of the 41 management trainees who joined the group in 2018 were through the PPO route. “We believe it is a smarter strategy to hire someone who we have observed closely over a two-month summer internship, rather than to go back to campus for full-time placements and make hiring decisions about people who we have never met before, after 30-minute long interviews,” Mitra said.

COMPANIES QUICKER TO ROLL OUT PPOS
This year many companies are quicker in extending PPOs to talent they have tried and tested out, institute officials said. “This year, nearly double the number of companies (27) have rolled out pre-placement offers during June-August in comparison to 14 last year,” said Kanwal Kapil, dean, continuing education, consulting, alumni and placements, MDI Gurgaon.

The highest offer so far at the institute is Rs 28 lakh offered by P&G. “At present, many of the technology companies including ACT Fibernet and Intel have started offering PPOs,” Kapil said. “New companies which came for summer placements like P&G, MARS and Bajaj Auto have also offered PPOs,” he said.

At XLRI, top offer so far is Rs 39.7 lakh from Uber. JP Morgan Chase Markets, BCG, Uber, Microsoft, P&G, RB, HUL, Asian Paints, Mahindra, J&J, RPG, AB InBev, Cipla, Flipkart, and RPG are among the companies that have made offers at the institute, according to Uday Damodaran, chairperson, placements (two years PGDM programmes) at XLRI. “Initial numbers look promising,” he said."
2,2018-09-06,Nestle,"Amazon and Apple, with market capitalisation in excess of $1 trillion, already feature on the Wall Street hall of fame. On the other side of the globe, FMCG majors Hindustan Unilever (HUL), ITC or Nestle have also reached levels of valuation that, going by conventional metrics, would be considered pretty exclusive.

It is no wonder, therefore, that Indian consumer staples have begun September on a pretty weak note, with HUL, Nestle, Britannia, or Godrej Consumer losing as much as 10per cent in just about three days.

Before the declines, the stocks were trading at 53-57 times FY20 projected earnings, while Amazon and Tencent are trading at 52 and 31 times based on 2019 earnings.

Indeed, Netflix is the only company among the global technology companies where the PE multiple is higher than those for Indian consumer companies. The average P/E of Indian FMCG companies (excluding ITC) is 66per cent and 95per cent premium to FAANG and Chinese technology stocks.

The distended valuation of FMCG stocks can be gauged from the fact that FMCG stocks are trading at three standard deviations from their 10-year mean, a rare phenomenon. The expanded PE multiples suggest that stocks are pricing in earnings growth of 15-23per cent for the next ten years, much higher than historically achieved in the most of the FMCG counters.

For instance, HUL would be required to grow its FCF at 22per cent CAGR over FY18-28 to justify the current stock price, according to CLSA.

The PE multiple re-rating has been the prime driver of stock performance for FMCG firms as they have contributed nearly half of total returns in many cases. The FMCG sector valuation traded at 33 and 24 times five and ten years ago. The PE premium of FMCG companies compared with the Nifty has reached a record high level of 160per cent as compared with the 10-year average of 110per cent.

There are couple of reason why FMCG stocks trade at dizzy valuations. First, FMCGs are considered safe and have drawn significant investor interest during periods of uncertainty. Second, with polls just a year way, the government has increased allocation to the farm sector, and FMCGs are direct beneficiaries of an increase in rural consumption.

Third, there is acute investor focus on high corporate governance, healthy cash generation, and the domestic nature of business. Fourth, there is improvement in the growth profiles of companies after a few quarters of pain due to issues like demonetisation, and inventory destocking before GST roll-out.

The latest declines show that the Street is gradually realising that such valuations are not sustainable.

CLSA believes that there is an extend period of euphoria in staples. It said in a note released on September 3 that consumer staples in India have always been a structural story and hence, stocks always command a premium, but the extent of PE expansion recently has probably surprised the most bullish of investors.

The reverse DCF analysis of CLSA suggests that the 10-year implied growth rate in most cases is at a much higher pace than the past decade, and on a higher base.

Similarly, Credit Suisse cut is weightage on consumer staples by 1.5per cent citing overvaluation."
3,2018-09-11,Nestle,"NEW DELHI: India's public spending on agriculture research and development is not far behind neighbouring China, Niti Aayog member Ramesh Chand said Tuesday.

He however expressed concern that private sector is investing in other places than in India's agriculture Research and Development (R&D) and this need to be changed.

Chand said the food demand is set to rise with increase in population and the technology innovation will be a key driver to achieve the desired production.

He was participating in a panel discussion on the report 'Fixing Asia's Food System' commissioned by Cargill India.

""The report says that India's public spending is 0.40 per cent of farm GDP on agri R&D whereas Brazil spends much more. But public spending on agri R&D is still not that bad here. We are not far behind China,"" he said.

Private investment in agri R&D is not much in India. However of late in China, private investment in farm research is on the rise. It is rising rapidly as compared to the public funding in China, he said.

""Globally, more intellectual property rights in farm technologies are being created by private sector. So, I do not say private sector is avoiding investment in agriculture,"" Chand said.

Emphasising the need to use technology in a more balanced way, Chand said technology used in the Green Revolution period had some adverse effects as it promoted use of fertilisers and pesticides. However, any shift from this would be a ""dangerous trend"" for the country.

He also talked about creating awareness on nutritious foods and absence of science in food manufacturing in the country.

Talking about food wastage, Walmart India CEO And President Krish Iyer said it is a serious problem and needs to be curbed given constrains of natural resources to grow food to meet the needs of the rising population.

Iyer enumerated four steps that retailers could take to check food wastage at supplier and retail levels -- upgradation of inventory system, partnering with farmers and supply chain, modification/elimination of some standard store operation and consumer awareness.

Nestle India Managing Director and Chairman Suresh Narayanan said the challenge in the country is not only about quality nutrition but also about awareness on what constitutes good nutrition and healthy habits.

Food safety regulator FSSAI's chief management services officer Madhavi Das and Cargill India Chairman Siraj Chaudhry were also present at the event."

6,2018-09-19,Nestle,"Today any list of India’s top paid CEOs would be incomplete without a mention of AM Naik. But there was a time when the L&T lifer thought he would retire drawing a salary of just Rs 1,000.

Of course, that changed within 12 months of him joining the company. “I didn’t expect it [to make this much money],” Naik told ETPanache during an interview at his office in suburban Mumbai. “I thought I would retire when I get Rs 1,000. But I got it in the first year itself. I started at Rs 670. On confirmation I got Rs 760 and then six months later, after the annual review, I got Rs 950. A month after that there was a Union agreement and everyone got Rs 75 more. That’s how I started getting Rs 1,025.”


Not in the family
Naik narrates his story simply. He nibbles on his popcorn and shares a short explanation of his rise as CEO of the company where he started as an engineer. Stock options were allotted to employees. The company grew, and so did he and the value of the stocks. Employees became “[rupees] millionaires and crorepatis”.

“Now everyone was retiring in a much more prosperous manner,” he said, making him realise that he now had the means to focus on philanthropy. Around two years ago, along with announcing his decision of stepping down from the active leadership of the company, Naik revealed that he would be giving 75 per cent of his wealth to charity. That number could well become 100.

“In the unlikely event if my son and daughter-in-law [Jignesh and Rucha] don’t come back to India, then after me a good part of the balance will also go away to charity,” he said, adding, “They don’t need it [the money]. In fact, they encourage me to give it away. They have never objected to my decisions. They have only supported me in my plans.” Those plans include the building of a speciality hospital to treat cancer, a general hospital, an eye hospital, and a nursing college, all in Gujarat, his “janmabhoomi [birthplace],” over the next five years. These initiatives will be executed under the aegis of the Nirali Memorial Medical Trust, named after Naik’s granddaughter (son’s daughter) who died from cancer at the age of two.

The mistake
Ask him about the paradox of both his son and daughter making a life in the US, given that he is such a proud Indian, and he calls it ‘his mistake’.


AgenciesAM Naik's son Jignesh (L) and daughter-in-law Rucha
“Every day or every other month I encourage them to come back. I call it my mistake because I was very keen that they leave,” he shared. “In 1991, colleges were shut down across India owing to social unrest. My son was studying at Anand in Gujarat at the time. He would leave every Sunday night for Anand and return on Monday or Tuesday. The same routine followed for almost five months, as the students were expected to sign the register once every week. So, I also got fed up. And I sent him away in 1991. I could give him $5,000 at the time. After that he managed on his own, doing part-time jobs.”

His daughter Pratiksha, on the other hand, moved to the US after marriage. “That was just a natural turn of events. It was my initiative to send them away. Hence I call it my mistake,” he added.

No free lunches
As a man with a taste for austerity — his wardrobe comprises just six shirts, three suits and two pairs of shoes — Naik knows the true worth of wealth. And that’s why he doesn’t rely on others for financial help to fund each of his initiatives. “I don’t ask others [for money] because I don’t like to plead with them. When we expanded our school, and built a new campus, a lot of people promised that they’d give [donate towards the project], but hardly 10 per cent people responded. So, after that I decided I will never go to anyone ,” he said."
7,2018-09-26,Nestle,"Packaged foods maker Nestle has forayed in the consumer-facing small appliances category to fuel coffee consumption and push one of its mainstay brands Nescafe, the company said on Wednesday. It is in the process of rolling out app-based coffee machines, which it will sell through non-FMCG distribution channels as well. Addressing the media at a roundtable at its Gurgaon headquarters on Wednesday, company chairman Suresh Narayanan said: “We are seeing a surge of speciality coffee outlets, and coffee consumption is growing specially among millennial consumers.” 

The company, which crossed the Rs 10,000-crore sales threshold last year, said India is among its first few markets to begin retailing the smartphone-connected machines.

On the India impact of the global $7.15 billion Nestle-Starbucks licensing deal which was concluded last month, Narayanan said it would pan out in India as well, though not in the immediate short term.

The licensing deal grants the Swiss food giant to market Starbucks’ packaged coffees and teas around the world, including Starbucks, Seattle’s Best Coffee and Teavana."

  structures. When it becomes unmanageable, we will hike prices selectively, Suresh Narayanan, MD, Nestle India, tells Ajaya Sharma of ET Now in an exclusive interview. Edited excerpts: 


Consumer companies seem to be in a good shape in volume term. How confident are you regarding growth in next few quarters?
We have been recording very steady volume growth for the last six-seven quarters and it is secular across categories. That is what is making the difference. In overall terms, this has been the trend in the consumption goods sector itself. It has got to do with the fact that the consumption story in India is becoming stronger and it is subject to a satisfactory monsoon. This year it looks more than satisfactory and with rural growth having an uptick in the last couple of quarters, the consumption sector can look forward to some healthy period of growth in the coming period as well.


Is there a visibility that the healthy volume growth may sustain for next few quarters at least?
As an economy we have gone through the bumps of demonetisation, and the process of rationalisation of GST rates. There was also turbulence in terms of the wholesale business because of these changes. That has now settled in. By and large, most organisations including Nestle are facing a period of relatively stable growth and it is the hope of companies like mine that this trend continues into the future as well. It does not look like the music is going to stop very soon but again, I am not a soothsayer. All I can say is that the trend seemed to have been positive in the past and hopefully will continue to be likewise in the future.


I read your commentary recently. You said that Nestle India wants to be a complete foods company. What is the overall strategy?
As I have mentioned before the challenge at Nestle is not what to launch but when to launch and we have put growth as the centre piece of our strategy. That is bearing fruits in terms of not only secular growth but also growth over a period of time in volume as well as value terms. I made a comment on the breakfast opportunity. Breakfast is the biggest and the most important source of nutrition for the day. 



 If that is true in nutritional terms, then as a company, I can say in all humility that starting from milk to coffee to ready-to-drink to Maggi atta and oats noodles to breakfast cereals, NesPlus and yogurts, we really have a full range of products that can be offered to the consumer. Over a period of time, we will build on this opportunity in the portfolio of the company.


Your numbers are back and perhaps higher than what it was before the Maggi debacle. Are you happy about it?
Leadership is always a very happy journey. When you see people around you smile you also thrive. My satisfaction as a leader in this company has been the fact that I have been able to contribute in a small way to the uptick in the fortunes of the company. But beyond me, it is consumers and stakeholders who have played a very important role in what has been done. By no stretch of imagination, do I talk of complacence because that is a sign of weakness to come.

What we have achieved as a company gives me a lot of strength and humility that beyond me, there are so many millions of people who are making such a positive impact on the company. I live for the purpose and values of this organisation and in the future, if the consumers continue to bless me and to bless the products of this company, we will continue to be one of the valued companies in this country.


What about industry margins? 
In the first half, we have had very clearly enhanced margins, 500 to 600 bps on operating margins. That really came on operating profits and that really came out of the kind of tailwind effects that we have had on commodities together with some cost rationalisation and efficiencies that we have put in. Plus Maggi also came back has given us a scale effect. 

As we look forward, clearly the clouds are gathering. This round of petroleum price increases and also of the devaluation of the currency is clearly going to have an impact on the overall cost structures that we have. We are still confident that with the current levels we should be able to mitigate a lot of what is happening but if it really goes beyond a threshold, then we might have to take selective price increases.


How is the growth coming in from the tier II, tier III towns? Some of your peers are saying that there is a lot of vibrancy and buoyancy beyond the metros.
No I always say that there are many Indias within India and I would probably echo some of the comments that you are hearing from the industry. Tier II, tier III are really starting to perform well. Also if you look at the e-commerce business, lot of the orders are coming from tier II and tier III and that only tells you that there is a huge amount of latent demand because I would really call it the convergence of aspirations. 

There is a convergence because of the whole telecom boom that is happening in the country. There is a convergence of aspirations on lifestyles and values between semi-urban rural India and urban India. That is leading and fuelling the demand that we are starting to see. 


Would 3% to 5% price hikes suffice if they need to be?
I do not wish to speculate on price increases. All that I would say is that since I have put growth and volume growth at the centre piece, I would try my damned best to mitigate as much as possible the cost increases that come my way. Therefore when I say selective, it is only when it becomes unmanageable that we may have to do a trade-off."

11,2018-09-28,Nestle,"NEW DELHI: Nestle has entered the consumer-facing small appliances category to fuel coffee consumption and push one of its mainstay brands, Nescafe, the company said on Wednesday. It is in the process of launching app-based coffee machines, which will be sold through non-FMCG distribution channels as well.

Addressing the media at a roundtable at its Gurugram headquarters on Wednesday, Nestle India chairman Suresh Narayanan said: “We are seeing a surge of speciality coffee outlets, and coffee consumption is growing specially among millennial consumers.”

The company said India is among its first few markets to begin retailing the smartphone-connected machines.

On the India impact of the global $7.15 billion Nestle-Starbucks licensing deal, which was concluded last month, Narayanan said it would pan out in India as well, though not in the immediate term. The licensing deal grants the Swiss food giant the right to market Starbucks’ packaged coffees and teas around the world, including Starbucks, Seattle’s Best Coffee and Teavana."
10,2018-09-28,Nestle,"NEW DELHI: Hindustan Unilever and Nestle plan to selectively increase prices of their products to take into account higher crude oil and petrol costs, the rupee’s depreciation against the dollar and more expensive commodities such as wheat.

“If crude remains where it is and if the rupee has depreciated, of course there are headwinds as far as costs are concerned,” Sanjiv Mehta, chairman of consumer goods giant HUL, told ET on Wednesday on the sidelines of the 45th national management convention of the AIMA. “There will be some price increases, though we will keep the price-value equation intact.”

Suresh Narayanan, chairman of Nestle India, the country’s biggest packaged foods maker, also said price increases are on the cards.

“Headwinds on commodities have already started and with the combination of the depreciating rupee and spiralling oil prices, we would take up prices selectively in some categories,” Narayanan told a media roundtable at the company’s headquarters in Gurugram. Nestle India’s logistics providers, too, are looking to renegotiate rates after record high petrol and diesel prices.

Mehta declined to comment on when and by how much prices would increase. “We don’t indicate pricing guidance. Price increases would not be based on a one-to-one correlation with input costs and we will keep the price-value equation intact. We are always circumspect when it comes to a pricing decision,” he said.

Mehta said HUL had dropped prices in November after the Goods & Services Tax was introduced last year and an increase in prices now would likely not hurt consumers.

“Even if the price goes up now because of input costs and the devaluation of the rupee, we believe the consumer will be cushioned,” he said.

ET reported in its September 7 edition that prices of daily consumption products would increase by about 5% starting in the third quarter, citing companies such as Britannia and Parle Products.

The impact of the minimum support price — guaranteed by the government to farmers for their produce — has been in the range of 10-12% and is in itself steep, the companies said. However, the companies said they will not pass on the entire burden to consumers because it could hamper growth.

“We will try and ensure that price increases are selective and growth doesn’t get impacted,” Narayanan said.

On the consumption outlook given the inflationary environment, Mehta said: “Market consumption does not change overnight. Definitely the market bottomed out when we saw a period when we had two consecutive years of drought to now, when volume growth has moved up.”

Petrol prices have crossed Rs 90 a litre in Mumbai on increasing global prices of crude oil, of which India is a net importer, further impacted by the falling rupee. Crude derivatives, which are key inputs for FMCG companies, and petroleum derivatives used in packaging material including bottles and tubes, have also become more expensive. However, Mehta said farm loan waivers and GST augur well for consumption, especially in the rural areas."

0,2018-10-01,Nestle,"Nestle, Unilever and Coca-Cola are among companies shortlisted by GlaxoSmith-Kline for the second round of bidding for its Indian nutrition business, which includes the prized Horlicks brand, people familiar with the development told ET.

Negotiations for the GSK Consumer portfolio are set to intensify as fresh rounds of management committee meetings are scheduled in London next week, they said.

The highly competitive auction process had seen some of the world’s biggest food and drinks companies including PepsiCo, Reckitt Benckiser, General Mills, Danone, and Kellogg’s besides homegrown ITC and private equity buyout funds like KKR vie for the GSK Consumer portfolio.

While some initial bidders have opted out, some others were not shortlisted for the second round. It’s not clear how many bidders are still in the reckoning.

GlaxoSmithKline Plc CEO Emma Walmsley had in March announced that the company is initiating a strategic review of Horlicks and its other consumer healthcare nutrition products, and that it’s exploring partial or full sale of its 72.5% stake in in its Indian subsidiary GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare.



The move — meant to help fund GSK’s $13-billion buyout of Novartis’ stake in their consumer healthcare joint venture — triggered a wave of interest from global and local consumer goods makers.

Though a stagnant category in terms of growth, industry watchers said there is huge potential for scale up for malt beverage drinks in a key emerging market such as India.

Sources familiar with the review process said they expect the bids for GSK’s shareholding in the Indian nutrition business to be in the range of $2.75 billion to $3.2 billion.

Spokespersons of Nestle and Coca-Cola said they would not comment on speculation. An email query to Hindustan Unilever elicited no response as of press time Sunday.

A spokesperson for GSK Consumer Healthcare said the purpose of the review was to assess strategic options for its nutrition brands such as Horlicks and Boost. “We expect the outcome of the strategic review to be concluded around the end of 2018,” the spokesperson said. “There can be no assurance that the review process will result in any transaction.” 

The person said India is a priority market for GSK. “The consumer healthcare business will continue to invest in growth opportunities for its OTC and oral health brands, such as Sensodyne and Eno.” While the India arm of Nestle, the world’s largest food company, sells malt drink Milo, it remains a small brand in a market dominated by Horlicks.

Hence its interest in the GSK brands, an official closely involved in the developments said. Nestle is looking to cross-synergise Milo’s distribution through pharmacy channels that already sell its infant food brands like Cerelac and Nan, the person said. 

Anglo-Dutch firm Unilever is looking to step up its play in foods globally, led by former India chief executive Nitin Paranjpe, who is president of the company’s Rotterdam-based food and refreshment business. 

HUL reported sales of Rs 1,147 crore from its foods division (with brands like Knorr, Kissan, Annapurna) during FY18. The company’s refreshments business (which includes Brooke Bond, Bru, Lipton and Kwality Walls) did annual sales of Rs 5,181crore. Foods and refreshment, which the company merged in July this year, together make up for 18% of HUL’s annual 35,000-crore turnover. 

Coca-Cola has also progressed to the final stages of negotiation with Kraft Heinz’s Indian consumer brand portfolio such as milk drink Complan, Nycil talcum powder, Sampriti Ghee and energy drink powder Glucon D. So, it could pose potential CCI related antitrust issues, some of the sources said."
2,2018-10-04,Nestle,"MILAN: European shares fell in early trade on Thursday, led lower by defensive stocks, while banks tracked gains by their US peers after strong data lifted Treasury yields to their highest since mid-2011.

 The pan-European STOXX 600 benchmark index was down 0.5 per cent by 0726 GMT. Germany's DAX also declined 0.5 per cent and the UK's FTSE fell 0.6 per cent.

 Defensive companies including consumer and healthcare stocks were the main drag on the STOXX. Shares in British American Tobacco, Nestle and Novartis were down between 0.6 and 3.7 per cent.

 Their losses were partly offset by gains among banks , which tend to benefit from rising rates and bond yields. German lenders Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank were up 1.9 and 1.5 per cent respectively, as German 10-year bond yields hit a 4-1/2 month high.

 Some Italian banks, however, remained under pressure as investors monitored developments in Rome, where the government is trying to finalised budget details after clashing with the EU over its deficit targets.

 Danske Bank fell 2.3 per cent after it discontinued its share buyback programme and said it was in talks with US authorities about non-resident accounts at its Estonian branch, which are at the centre of a $235 billion money laundering scandal."

4,2018-10-09,Nestle,"Drink companies Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Nestle were found to be the world's biggest producers of plastic trash, a report by environmental group Greenpeace said on Tuesday.

 Working with the Break Free From Plastic movement, Greenpeace said it orchestrated 239 plastic clean-ups in 42 countries around the world, which resulted in the audit of 187,000 pieces of plastic trash. The aim was to get a picture of how large corporations contribute to the problem of pollution.

 Coca-Cola, the world's largest soft drink maker, was the top waste producer, Greenpeace said, with Coke-branded plastic trash found in 40 of the 42 countries.

 ""These brand audits offer undeniable proof of the role that corporations play in perpetuating the global plastic pollution crisis,"" said Von Hernandez, global coordinator for Break Free From Plastic.

 Overall, the most common type of plastic found was polystyrene, which goes into packaging and foam coffee cups, followed closely by PET, used in bottles and containers.

 ""We share Greenpeace's goal of eliminating waste from the ocean and are prepared to do our part to help address this important challenge,"" a Coke spokesman said in a statement. The company has pledged to collect and recycle a bottle or can for every one it sells by 2030.

 All three companies have made pledges about their packaging for 2025. Coke says all its packaging will be recyclable, Nestle says it will be recyclable or reusable and PepsiCo says it will be recyclable, compostable or biodegradable.

 They are all also working to use recycled content in their packaging.

 Nestle, the world's largest food and drink maker, said it recognised the issue and is working hard to eliminate non-recyclable plastics. It said it was also exploring different packaging solutions and ways to facilitate recycling and eliminate plastic waste.

 PepsiCo was not immediately available to comment outside regular U.S. business hours."
5,2018-10-11,Nestle,"NEW DELHI|MUMBAI: Zydus Cadila Group has mounted an aggressive Rs 4,500 crore offer for the Kraft Heinz Company’s consumer brand business in India, outbidding the Coca-Cola Company for a portfolio that includes children’s milk drink Complan, said multiple sources aware of the developments. 

The Cadila Group’s bid is conditional. Coca-Cola, the world’s largest beverage company, is now also actively pursuing GSK Consumer’s Horlicks in a potential $4 billion transaction and has been shortlisted with Nestle and Unilever for the second round of negotiations. The Kraft Heinz deal is expected to close within a month, the officials said. Ahmedabad-based Cadila Group is working with investment bank Avendus. 

Once selected, Cadila may rope in a private equity partner for financing support. It had sent feelers to PE groups True North, Temasek, Warburg Pincus and Carlyle to partner them and may place its equity in a back-to-back deal. Mails sent to Kraft Heinz and Cadila did not generate a response till the time of going to press. Coca-Cola declined to comment. 


DIFFERENT DEAL STRUCTURES 
ET reported on September 6 that Coca-Cola and Zydus Cadila were in the running for the sale. However, a private consortium of Apax and Arpwood Partners made a strong play and emerged as a surprise bidder in the final round, until Kraft Heinz tweaked the deal. 



Kraft Heinz unexpectedly decided last month to sell the European holding company that houses the India operations and wants the buyer to absorb the tax losses of that entity, registered in Italy. The original plan was to sell only the Indian operations and brands. The Italian company is held by an arm of the US parent that is registered in the Netherlands. Coca-Cola’s offer is for the European entity, while Cadila has bid only for the Indian operations. “From a pure financial bid perspective, Cadila’s bid is 10-15% higher than that of Coca-Cola, but it is only for the local operations. 

The seller has to decide which structure to approve,” said one official. As an Indian company, Cadila may find it difficult to get regulatory approvals to buy an offshore entity that has most of its assets in India. Additionally, such a move may also put them on the wrong side of the tax department, especially after the Vodafone tax matter. “The Cadila bid has several conditions and the company has sought several CPs and safeguards. The sellers have other tax-related issues as well, which as a buyer, Cadila is not willing to absorb. So the negotiations are still ongoing,” said another official. Coke, according to officials, was predominantly keen on only Glucon D brand but with the complicated transaction dragging chose to focus aggressively on Horlicks instead. Kraft Heinz’s consumer business in India spans Complan, talcum powder Nycil, glucose powder drink Glucon-D and Sampriti Ghee. The brands generated approximately `1,200 crore in sales ($190 million), led by Complan and Glucon-D. A diversified portfolio and steep valuations deterred potential buyers such as Danone, Tata Group, Nestle, Dabur, Wipro Consumer and ITC."
6,2018-10-15,Nestle,"ET Intelligence Group: For those on the Street scouting to cherry-pick quality stocks in the wake of the recent correction, HUL is a strong temptation. The consumer goods behemoth’s second quarter performance was on expected lines with doubledigit volume growth for the fourth consecutive quarter on a base of 4 per cent volume growth a year ago.

Despite the company’s strong first quarter performance, analysts had downgraded its stock on concerns over stretched valuations and imminent risks to a sustained strong performance. The stock steadily weakened 13 per cent from its record high hit two months ago.

The latest quarterly performance, however, should allay valuation concerns. The stock is now trading at 59.2 times its earnings against the peak of 72.5. The company posted 10 per cent volume growth on a base of 4 per cent growth a year ago. The volume growth is expected to temper down as the high base effect kicks in from the current quarter.

HUL has made all the right moves — cutting advertising spend, reining in other expenses and passing on input cost inflation over to the consumers. While raw material cost as a proportion of revenues increased, the ad spend and other expenses as a percentage of revenues declined from the year-ago levels. The result: strong revenue growth of 12 per cent and 160 basis points improvement in ebitda margins despite headwinds of a depreciating rupee and escalated oil prices.

Strong brands, economies of scale and agile execution help HUL tide over macro-economic headwinds. It deploys several levers like price increases, moderating ad spends, acquisition of brands to improve its portfolio and changing revenue mix to mitigate headwinds. Rural demand continues to grow better than the urban one, a good sign for the consumer behemoth that earns nearly half its revenues from Bharat.

However, factors like weak rupee, escalated oil prices, increased competitive intensity as well as high base effect in the coming quarters may limit a major upside in the stock price. HUL also faces competition on the bourses from stocks of its peers like Britannia and Nestle that too are trading at similar valuations post the recent correction. Investors are in for a difficult choice in the consumer goods sector."
7,2018-10-22,Nestle,"NEW DELHI: A probe by the GST anti-profiteering agency has found that Nestle India has profiteered about Rs 100 crore by not passing on GST rate cut benefit to consumers and the FMCG major has suo motu deposited Rs 16.58 crore in the consumer welfare fund.

The Directorate General of Anti Profiteering (DGAP) has submitted its report to the National Anti-Profiteering Authority (NAA), in which it has concluded that Nestle India had not reduced prices of certain products in proportion to the cut in Goods and Services Tax (GST) rate, an official said.

When contacted, a Nestle India spokesperson said the company has suo motu deposited Rs 16.58 crore in the Consumer Welfare Fund taking into account cases where it could not pass on the tax rate cut benefits to consumers.

""We wish to reiterate that in situations where the benefit could not be passed on instantly by reduction in Maximum Retail Price or increase in grammage, the amount of Rs 16.58 crore was set aside to be subsequently passed on and was not reckoned either in sales or in profit.

""At our request, the authority through its communication had advised us to provisionally deposit the amount computed by us, suo motu, in the Consumer Welfare Fund, which has been done,” Nestle India said.

Nestle India manufactures most popular instant noodles brand Maggi, coffee brand Nescafe, chocolates like Kitkat, Munch, Milkybar. It also manufactures milk products, and tomato ketchups.

As per the provisions of GST law, a Consumer Welfare Fund has been set up wherein undue benefits made by businesses due to tax rate cut have to be deposited in cases where it could not be passed on to identified consumers.

The GST anti-profiteering body probed a complaint against Nestle for not cutting prices of its products, despite a reduction in tax rates by the GST Council in variety of items with effect from November 15, last year.

The council had cut rates on 178 products, including chocolates, malt extract and food preparations of flour, starch or malt extract, Waffles and wafers coated with chocolate or containing chocolate, and extract, essence and concentrates of coffee, miscellaneous food preparations.

""Once a profiteering complaint is received against a company, the DGAP has the powers to look into the books of accounts and see if the benefits of tax rate cuts have been passed on in other products manufactured by the company as well. The DGAP has found profiteering to the tune of Rs 100 crore in the case of Nestle India,"" an official said.

Nestle India, in an e-mailed response, said as a responsible corporate citizen, it has passed on the benefits of GST to consumers.

""We are hopeful that the procedure followed to pass on the GST benefit will be appreciated by the National Anti-Profiteering Authority and our stand will be vindicated,"" the Nestle India spokesperson had said earlier in the day.

The spokesperson further said that Nestle, along with many other industry members, have been requesting the government for clear rules and regulations to be framed on anti-profiteering to avoid any confusion and ambiguity. ""This will support ease of doing business"".

As per the structure of the anti-profiteering mechanism in the GST regime, complaints of local nature will be first sent to the state-level 'screening committee', while those of national level will be marked for the 'standing committee'. If the complaints have merit, the committees refer them to the DGAP.

The DGAP gives its report to the NAA for further action, which may include fine and extreme penalty like cancellation of registration.

""The NAA would hear the company and also the complainant before passing a final order. The quantum of profiteering might go up or down depending on the case presented before the authority,"" the official added."

The Morningstar Conference, and also we are planning to put money into India because we have a new fund and it is taking more time. I hope, we will be able to accelerate that.


What gives you that confidence? Do you think that we are at the end of the pain when it comes to India?
Well we know there is a liquidity crisis, we know that you had this problem with the infrastructure company and all these issues are at play and therefore the market has gone down may be a little bit too far. The currency has gone down as well. Put this all together and it means there are bargains, there are good opportunities.


You have been making a call that one should always go and commit when bear markets are on. Do you think the current route of selling in emerging markets across categories is a buying opportunity?
Yes. We are at a stage where with interest rate going up in the US, currencies in emerging markets are going down dramatically and the markets themselves have gone down. It is an opportunity to start buying. I am not saying we are at the absolute bottom, no one can predict whether it is going to be 20%, 30% at the beginning of the year. Who knew emerging markets would go down by 20 odd percent and we are now about 22-23% on the index. The important thing to remember now is that some companies are bargains, tremendous opportunities but some are not. We now have to separate the men from the boys, so to speak. 

You have to stay away from companies that have weak balance sheets, do not pay dividends and have poor management. Companies that have strong balance sheets, pay dividends and have a forward looking management are going to be the winners. Separate these two and do not pay so much attention to the overall index.


Emerging markets currently account for nearly 30% to 35% of the global market cap. That is a sizable chunk. It is no longer a billion dollar or a two billion dollar market. This 30% market cap now has corrected by 50% to 15%. So, even though emerging markets are supposed to be high growth pockets, why are these market correcting at a time when growth in general has been very precious?
It is mainly because of what has happened in the US. We must remember the biggest pool of money globally is in the US and so what US investors do, have a big impact. Of course, that impact is declining. As emerging markets grow internally, you are getting big pockets of money investing in the local markets. India, for example, has a big domestic market. But nevertheless, people look to the US and the US dollar. They trust the US dollar. 

If interest rates are going up in the US, money flows in to the US dollar until interest rates in emerging countries catch up. Look at Europe, the euro is still paying almost zero per cent interest. That has got to come up. Once that comes up, you may see money flowing out of US and into emerging markets. By the way, you have already seen reversal. We have seen money going into emerging markets recently as a result of these developments.


You believe that crude could go up all the way to $100. That is like a double edged sword, which is not working in favour of India. Do you think if crude were to move up higher and get to $100 per barrel, the whole India investment hypothesis will change?
No, not really We must remember India is a big country. There are lot of things going on where oil prices may not impact. For example, you have got huge coal resources. Agreed coal is polluting but the reality is that when people want to produce fuel, then coal becomes a big factor. You have increased your solar. You have increased your wind. So yes, oil does have an impact but it does not have to be disastrous and it depends again on the industry. In some industries, power consumption is not a big factor, it is very small part of their total cost. 


Where do you find tactical opportunities when it comes to India? A year back. it was financials, but look what is happening with financials right now. Just about everyone is shunning even quality NBFCs. Is that the right pocket to hunt now?
There are going to be opportunities. You would think micro lending and the non-banking institutions would be dangerous but there are opportunities in this sector and we are looking at that very carefully.


COMMODITIES WILL CONTINUE TO BE A BIG FACTOR

In your previous avatar you have bought stocks like Reliance. You have bought nearly 5-7% in Sesa Goa. What is your view on commodities first and then commodity stocks as we stare at a trade war and a potential slowdown in China?
Commodities will continue to be a big factor. Just take your oil. Companies that are producing oil are going to be doing very well with the higher oil price. I always tell people do not give up on commodities because commodities are required and in increasing quantities. We must remember that two most populated countries in the world India and China are going to use more and more commodities. It is going to be a big challenge because there are environmental problems with commodities as you know. I do not think commodities are not going to get cheap. They are going to get more expensive. 


Parallels are being drawn between 2008 and 2018, looking at the quantum of the selloff. If one works with an assumption that the US economy will start slowing down in 12 to 18 months after the sugar rush which they are enjoying because of tax cuts, how do you see the flow of money moving and changing?
You will see flow out of the US increasing because as you reach these higher interest rates, that will come to an end. There will be a point when inflation will not come up at the rate they are expecting it to. This is one of my big theses these days --we are not in an inflationary environment globally, we are in a deflationary environment. Why? Because of technology. Technology is making things cheaper. The CPI is based on a basket of goods which are changing. But if you look at the basics, the food prices are going down. The World Health Organisation is looking at these prices and they seeing a declining trend. We are in that kind of environment which I believe will hold up the rise of interest rates by central banks but as the US central bank slows down interest rate hikes, other banks around the world have to catch up because they have not yet risen as much as they should. So, you are going to see money flowing back to take advantage of these higher rates.


In that sense would you say the Reserve Bank of India has been a little behind the curve because just about everyone on the Street was expecting it to be a 50 bps hike but they chose to hold back.
In the case of India, I am a little bit on the other side of the equation because I think in India, the central bank has been in the past too aggressive about raising rates. It would be better in the Indian environment to have lower rates because it will help the community at large and industry at large. India is kind of a special case, It is not necessary to raise rates in order to contain inflation. If you want to contain inflation, you have to increase productivity and that means you have to reduce the regulatory environment. 

The single excise tax or GST is a giant step in the right direction because that has the impact of lowering inflation, reducing overall cost. I think India is a special case.


When you think of India, you think of consumption. Consumption is just such a large basket. Just about everything falls under the bracket. Take autos. In the market correction, auto stocks fell down.Do you believe it is the time to buy this decline in autos because whenever the economy recovers a little bit, the auto stocks will come back?
It is now time to look at companies that are advanced in electric automobiles because that is the future and not only for the domestic market but for exports. So the degree to which Tata Motors or any of these companies can develop an inexpensive electric vehicle will be very important going forward. That is what I would focus on. And the technology is here, there is no reason why this cannot be done.


WHAT MARK MOBIUS IS LOOKING FOR IN COS

You have been an emerging market veteran and you generally have been investing into emerging markets for over 25 years now. If you have to make a list of your favourite investable companies in India, what will it show?
My favourite companies in India are those that have strong balance sheets, number one, that are focussing on ESG factors, number two and are paying dividends.


What about valuations?
And the valuations of course. We look at price earnings, price to book but we found that these are not really good long-term indicators in itself. Of course, they are important but we are looking more at the growth. I am not so much interested in what the PE is today but what it is going to be in five years.


Can you give me an example that what is looking expensive today may look cheap tomorrow because growth will come back?
If you look at the banks here, if you really do the numbers and look at the non-performing loans, you will find that the price to book is very high because a lot of the assets have been wiped out. But then if you look forward, the reforms that are taking place in the banks could look pretty good going forward. So that is an example where you have to take a five year view.


So let us take the next five years, EVs is one that you talked about. Where do you think the big disruption is going to come in when it comes to India, economy, stock markets all put together?
The big disruption will be the impact of the internet and technology in general. The reason why I say that is that many of the traditional industries have not yet adopted a lot of the technology that is required. You take retail, they do not have an inventory control based on the internet, they do not have an inventory of their customer base. All these factors have to come in into play because they are going to be running into a tremendous competition.


The India romance always has been centred around consumption and when I say consumption it is autos, staples and durables. Would you buy an HUL, would you buy a Britannia or would you buy a Nestle with a five-year view?
This is a very good question because very often you will find these tremendous names, that are selling at very high multiples and again I have to emphasise what are they doing going forward? If they are going to stay where they are, I am not interested. If they are making innovations in their product base, in the way they manage their businesses then I am interested, that means growth. Even though the valuation may appear to be high now, if you are seeing that growth, going forward PE levels will go down, price to book levels will go down, dividend yields will go up that is what we are looking for.


In your investing career in India, I have been told that Templeton had nearly $10 billion directly, indirectly invested in India. Which is one business you regret buying late and one business you regret selling early?
I would say that more than business buying too late was probably the outsourcing businesses. We did not recognise the incredible potential there. Some of the mining companies, we bought a little bit too early. They had a lot of reforms to go through and the whole environmental issues came in play. We could have been waiting.


A year from now, the texture of the market would be a lot different than what we are at now. We also have a very big political risk as well. This year, you have got three state elections, the run up to the big 2019 election. What would you want to see from the government in the next one year because the big fear in the market is that they are bound to turn a little populist in the run up to the election.
I would say that if the current government could focus more strongly on the reforms that they announced when they were elected, that would go a long way towards strengthening their position. So is implementing these reforms more forcefully. A good example is what we are talking about; of foreign investment making it easier for investments to come in, particularly now because the opportunity is tremendous with the trade war between the US and China, India has got an incredible opportunity to garner some of this manufacturing.


Do you think there is a big political risk attached to the markets right now,? If the same government does not come to power, is it going to be a big derogatory factor for the equity momentum?
I do not think so because any government that gets in is going to be pushed to reform because with the internet and smartphones, everybody is aware of what is going on. The young generation are very impatient, they do not want to wait, they want action now and any government is going to be forced to act.


After an extremely successful career as an emerging market strategist with Franklin Templeton, normally people retire at this age, but you are starting your second innings. What prompted this?
Well I recognised that there was a new era taking place and it was time to get away from index investing and focus on the index. It was time to look at the ESG factors. So looking at all this, I said well maybe I better turn over a new leaf, separate myself from what went before and start something new and that is really the exciting thing,

When you hear the new ideas of the analysts it is just incredible. The analysts today are so much more advanced in technology it is quite something.


What is the mantra for you fitness because we have been seeing you for the last 15 years and not a single wrinkle, the skin is as glowing?
The key is to exercise everyday without fail. I get up in the morning, I get on the stationary bicycle, I read from my i-Pad. I read a book or something and then in the evening, I try to do some weight training. It is very important because as you get older you bones will get weak. Now my weakness is proved, that is the problem. I love sweets. So. when I come to India I go wow about Indian sweets. It is a real problem.


So Indian stocks or Indian sweets, where is the preferred choice right now?
Mark Mobius: They are both sweet."

   Kapoor, CEO and Aditya Agarwal, MD, India, Morningstar, chat with Ajaya Sharma of ET Now before the Morningstar Investment Conference.Edited excerpts: 


Two years ago when we met, it was all about emerging markets, ETFs and saying goodbye to US equities. But the reverse seems to be happening; emerging markets are in a downturn, passive investing has made a huge comeback and US markets continue to rise and shine. What is going on in the world?

Kunal Kapoor: If you look at things from a longer term perspective, clearly the US has done quite well and the dollar itself has been very strong and that explains a lot of the returns. Usually, when the dollar is strong, you get pressure on emerging markets equities. But sometimes, it takes longer for a cycle to change. Our analysts are saying on a relative valuation basis that we are finding fewer opportunities in the US today and more opportunities outside the US, including emerging markets for sure.


This is the longest bull market in the history of American equities after the Second World War, centred around just four names -- Alphabet, Facebook, Amazon and Netflix. If I talk to an average American investor, there is no scepticism and only optimism. It is just feeling like there is a carnival going on.

Kunal Kapoor: Well I do not think it is quite that extreme but certainly you do have a bifurcation in the US markets. But I do not think we should underestimate the meaningful impact of the tax cuts on the US. That has certainly been a very big positive this year for US equities. But clearly going into next year, that tailwind is not there.

If you look at it from a valuation perspective, you are starting to see some pretty significantly silly valuations in certain segments of the market and even a pullback like we had two weeks ago or so, saw really rapid movements in some of the technology names that had moved up. But the reality is that relative to some of the dotcom technology companies, the majority of the stocks you named -- Apple, Facebook -- are generating a lot of cash and are a lot more positively inclined from a profitability perspective than the technology companies of yester years. They are great businesses. The question is are they good values at this point as well?


 It seems like he is sailing on that Titanic but our boat is already beginning to rock a little bit.

Aditya Agarwal: I would not say that our boat is rocking. We are doing the right thing for the investors. We are talking for the investors, we stand for the investors. We have to look at the markets from a longer term perspective. The markets have been rising for the last three, five years in India as well. We have seen some 15-20% of contraction this year but we want to encourage investors to think long term and to stay put in equities over a longer term. This could be just a good opportunity to buy in fact, to add more value.


Easier said than done though but in the near term, are the concerns large and are we done with the pain?

Aditya Agarwal: It is hard to kind of say that but I would advocate that there are some pains in the short term. But with the elections coming up and with crude being a spoilsport, it is a good time to add and find value in the market.


Good news and good prices rarely come together. A year ago, there was only good news, prices were not great. Right now, there is only bad news. We are perhaps reaching that level where prices are becoming great. In last two years, cash in America is giving a return of 3% plus. That means bonds as well as cash will compete with equities. Is that a big setback for the ETFs now?

Kunal Kapoor: It is less so about the active passive and just the reality that the risk free rates are starting to go up. From the perspective of how you discount and look at individual equities, you have to clear a higher hurdle in general. As it pertains to passive and active, the real challenge is that expenses have continued to trend lower on the passive side. The reality is that zero expense offerings are going to happen in the US and that is pretty dramatic as it will mean you can basically invest at no cost. 

One of the challenges for passive investing is that a lot of the indexes are increasingly owning larger shares of some of the companies that you highlighted and we will see if some of those companies turn out to have been overvalued. That could be an opportunity for active managers to outperform, although active managers own lots of Apple and Facebook and other FAANG names. It is an interesting juxtaposition. 

This is why as an investor looking at things on a day-to-day basis, it is really best to use strategies like dollar cost averaging or rupee cost averaging and using strategies like that so you are not as beholden to the swings in the market. You are really building wealth over time which is really what investing is about.


You said that you are finding opportunities in the market. Where is that opportunity?

Aditya Agarwal: The investor needs to stick to asset allocations that suit the risk profile and kind of make sure that they are buying at every dip. Systematic investment plans (SIPs) are making sure whenever there is an opportunity, you are adding more to your portfolio.

One of the names that our analysts like here in India is Escorts. They like Escorts because they view it as a pure play agriculture name where the cycle is going to be long and as there continues to be automation in agriculture which a long-term trend. They like Escorts as pure play trend in that area. So that is one name we will be talking about today.


I am sure Escorts is not the only name your analysts like. Which are the other names?

Kunal Kapoor: That is the one I came prepared to talk about.


The new mantra with investors is Mutual Fund Sahi Hai, up until now it is looking good because the three-year returns for equity diversified as well as small cap schemes have given a positive return. But the three-year or five-year story will have a big scar, so to speak. Could that change the way for the SIP movement in India?

Aditya Agarwal: Absolutely. And that is where the value of advice comes in. The adviser needs to handhold the investors and be able to encourage the investors to stay invested. Of course, there may be another 5-10% of contraction and the returns could be negative or even out. But, these are the times to buy.


Escorts is just one side of the story. It is the whole rural agri push that you are betting on. So, what else?

Kunal Kapoor: Well one name that our analysts do not like as much right now is Nestle India and we will be talking about that as well and that is purely a valuation call that they do not find that the valuation is particularly compelling at this point.


You are in the business of rating mutual funds. Currently India has less number of listed stocks and more mutual fund schemes. Identify three categories or three schemes which could be called the go-to categories for three, five and 10 years. Your favourite large cap fund for three, five, 10 years, small cap and balanced or maybe debt?

Aditya Agarwal: I do not think we work that way. We definitely have our ratings on mutual funds and our opinion on different mutual funds but it is very difficult for me to just name three funds and forget the rest of them. It is very important to look at your asset allocation. It is really important to look at your goals.


Where do you have a positive opinion?

Aditya Agarwal: We put our analyst ratings on our website, we are pretty positive on certain HDFC funds, ICICI Prudential Funds; we are positive on DSP funds as well and there are plenty of them.
ET Now: DSP largely debt or equity?
Aditya Agarwal: Largely equity."
8,2018-10-23,Nestle,"NEW DELHI: Last week, Piramal Enterprises Ltd found itself engulfed in a different kind of crisis. A message on social media claimed that some real estate developers had defaulted on loans taken from Piramal Enterprises and its subsidiary Piramal Capital & Housing Finance (PCHFL). Piramal is not alone.

A few weeks ago, Nestle was in a spot after a WhatsApp message alleged there were poisonous substances in the products of its pet care entity Purina Petcare India. In September, the Infibeam Avenues stock lost 71% of its market value on a single day after a WhatsApp message circulated among traders raised concerns over the ecommerce company’s accounting practices. The message was attributed to Equirus Securities, which denied issuing any such information.

In July, Kerala-based Kalyan Jewellers claimed to have taken a hit of Rs 500 crore due to a spate of fake messages and videos on social media about the brand and its products. Fake news on social media platforms, earlier restricted to political parties and politicians, is making inroads into the corporate world, often leading to significant monetary and reputational damage, and companies are battling a tough terrain, according to lawyers, marketers and digital and social media agency heads.




In the Piramal case, the message read: “PEL News in Mumbai, in the limelight: Traders saying that Rs 1,500-1,800 crore loan default by a builder called Nahar Developers...That is why stock is down 10%.” Piramal informed the stock exchanges on Sunday about the rumours on its real estate lending portfolio and refuted them, saying that the companies mentioned in the messages had never defaulted on any interest or repayment obligation.

Nestle approached Check4Spam, a non-profit entity that verifies posts on social media. APurina Petcare India spokesperson said: “It has come to our notice that false information around our product is being circulated on select platforms. We are reassuring our consumers about the quality and safety of the product. There is a dedicated team which is monitoring the development and trying to identify if possible, the origin of the message.”

Check4Spam founder Shammas Oliyath said for verification, the entity gets a lot of posts which look like they are intended to malign companies and their products. People panic or get worried when they see news related to their favourite products, Oliyath said. “There are also posts which are particularly targeted at companies to malign them,” he added.

Fake news items busted by Check4Spam include those on Hamdard Laboratories not employing Hindus and non-Muslims, Red Bull having bull sperm, drinking Pepsi after consuming Polo or Mentos causing instant death, and Cadburys dairy milk having pork ingredients. APepsiCo spokesperson said the company has been noticing a trend of deceptive and defamatory content circulated on social media, which is a cause of concern.

“Misleading content showing that Kurkure has plastic has adversely affected the brand’s reputation,” the spokesperson said. “When our brands are repeatedly targeted with content that is fake and malicious and threatens our long-term equity, we take the legal recourse.” ""People are engaging content managers to monitor content and initiate appropriate civil or criminal action including defamation, take down notices, or getting an apology issued,"" said Tushar Ajinkya, head of forensics and fraud investigations practice at DSK Legal.

“However there could be instances where a potential rival can create multiple accounts and can retweet and share messages very quickly. That can be very hard to control,” he added. Ajinkya said companies can also request entities like Facebook to take down articles if they can prove prima facie that they are defamatory but there could be instances where certain articles may prima facie border upon truth which can be twisted and that can’t be easily proven as being defamatory.

According to Aditya Gupta, cofounder of iGenero, besides advertising to allay concerns and misinformation, companies can do little to prevent these instances. “At least on Facebook and Twitter, companies can write to them and they can act by blocking this content from people’s feed. But on WhatsApp it is very tough. The sheer reach and volume of the content is so high on the platform,” Gupta said.

While some companies don’t take the need for response and reputation management as seriously in India, larger ones such as Hindustan Unilever have big command centres set up to tackle such situations, said Zafar Rais, CEO of Mindshift Interactive. “Having a social media agency alone is not enough. Having proper monitoring tools in place that can capture data before it spirals into something bigger is important. We have built a base of digital evangelists and influencers for some of our brands to help tackle situations like these,” said Rais."
11,2018-10-24,Nestle,"It was a deluge of a different kind. India's biggest institutional investor Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) found itself in the middle of a major stock churn in the September quarter.

To bring in some perspective, the said quarter was also marked by heightened volatility over the IL&FS default crisis. 

LIC, which holds stake in over 320 companies, was seen reshuffling its portfolio heavily in financials, healthcare, oil & gas, chemical and information technology sectors, shareholding data for the September quarter suggests. 

Close to 30 companies caught LIC's fancy during the quarter gone by. The insurance behemoth raised its stake in auto majors Hero MotoCorp and Maruti Suzuki to 6.45 per cent and 6.55 per cent, respectively, from 6.40 per cent and 5.76 per cent in the preceding June quarter. 

LIC also upped exposure in TVS Motor to 1.75 per cent from 1.12 per cent during the same period. However, it offloaded some shares in Bajaj Auto and Mahindra & Mahindra, according to data available with ACE Equity till October 23. 

BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty plunged over 6 per cent in September even though for the quarter both the indices gained around 2 per cent. 

The insurance company also bought additional shares in select public sector banks, including Allahabad Bank (to 9.90 per cent from 9.89 per cent), Bank of Baroda (to 3.86 per cent from 3.18 per cent) and Indian Bank (to 1.89 per cent from 1.82 per cent). On the other hand, it slashed stake in Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, Vijaya Bank and YES Bank during the quarter under review. 



In the oil and gas space, it scooped up additional shares in GAIL, BPCL, Chennai Petroleum and Oil India for the quarter to September. 

Among FMCG majors, LIC further increased its holdings in Britannia Industries, Gillette India, Hindustan Unilever and Procter & Gamble Hygiene & Healthcare. However, it sold some shares of Colgate-Palmolive and Nestle during the quarter under review.

Piramal Enterprises, OFSS, Wipro, Blue Dart, Tata Consultancy Services, Crisil, Future Enterprises, Future Lifestyle, General Insurance Corporation of India, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Dewan Housing Finance Corporation and Grasim featured among companies where LIC increased its holding during the quarter under review. Shares of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation have plunged over 65 per cent in 2018 so far.

On the other hand, NTPC, Tata Power Company, Peninsula Land, Bata India, Arvind Ltd, National Aluminium, Larsen & Toubro, Sun Pharma, Merck, Cipla, REC, Bajaj Finserv, Titan, Rajesh Exports, Voltas, Pidilite, Chambal Fertilisers and Seshasayee Paper & Boards are a few where LIC reduced stake in July-September."

The NSE benchmark Nifty witnessed a highly volatile session ahead of its October series expiry. The index opened in the green, but failed to surpass the 10,300 level and corrected sharply towards 10,126.

However, it recovered more than 100 points from the intraday low and formed a Hammer candle followed by a Doji on the daily chart.

The index is witnessing a tug of war between the bulls and the bears near to its major juncture of 10,200 zone. Now, it has to hold above the 10,200 level with a follow up buying interest to head towards 10,280 and then 10,333-10,350. On the downside. supports were seen at 10,138 and then 10,100 levels.

On the option front, maximum Put OI was at 10,000 followed by 10,200 strike, while Call OI congestion was seen at 10,300 followed by 10,400 strikes. We have seen Call writing at 10,300, followed by 10,250 strike, while Put writing was seen at 10,000 followed by 10,200 strike. Option band signifies an immediate trading range between 10,138 and 10,333 levels.

13,2018-10-25,Nestle,"NEW DELHI | MUMBAI: Consumer goods maker Unilever, Nestle and Coca-Cola have begun due diligence on GlaxoSmithKline Consumer’s Indian nutrition business, which includes malt beverage drinks Horlicks and Boost, and is estimated to be worth about $4 billion, three people aware of the developments said.

The strategic sale has triggered interest among leading global and Indian consumer goods companies. GSK is being advised by Morgan Stanley and Greenhill. Besides the three suitors named above, other global companies that had expressed initial interest in the business include Pepsi-Co, Reckitt Benckiser, General Mills, Danone, Kellogg, ITC, and private equity fund KKR. They either dropped out or didn’t make it to the second round of bids.

Danone chief executive Emmanuel Faber said at an investor event in the UK two days ago that the company is not interested in GSK’s nutrition business. “We don’t believe the evaluations will meet the metrics that we need to grow our business in India. We will pass on this huge opportunity.”

Although malt beverage drinks is a stagnant category, industry watchers say there is huge potential for scale-up in a key emerging market like India.

“Earlier this year, GSK had announced a strategic review for its nutrition business globally. The review is expected to be concluded in December, 2018,” a GSK Consumer Healthcare spokesperson said in response to ET’s query. 

“We do not have anything to add to it at this point in time.” Spokespersons at HUL, Nestle and Coca-Cola said they wouldnot comment on ‘speculation’. The due diligence process follows management committee meetings, which took place at GSK’s headquarters in London last month.

Earlier in March, GlaxoSmith-Kline Plc. chief executive Emma Walmsley had announced a strategic review of Horlicks and its other consumer healthcare nutrition products, adding that the company is exploring partial or full sale of its 72.5% stake in its Indian subsidiary GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare.



The move is aimed at funding GSK’s $13-billion buyout of the Novartis stake in their consumer healthcare joint venture. Nestle India, which already sells malt drink Milo, is looking to widen its portfolio and the acquisition of Horlicks would give it immediate category leadership, besides helping the food giant to cross-synergise Milo’s distribution through pharmacy channels that already sell its infant food brands Cerelac and Nan, an official close to the process said.

For Anglo-Dutch major Unilever, on the other hand, foods happen to be the core growing business, and it had merged foods and refreshment in July this year for a bigger leverage in the space. Its foods business, which has brands such as Knorr, Kissan and Annapurna, and refreshment which includes Brooke Bond, Bru, Lipton and Kwality Walls, together account for 18% of HUL’s Rs 35,000-crore annual turnover.

Coca-Cola, meanwhile, has been making several attempts to hedge risks and move beyond its core soft drinks business as consumers move away from sugary soda. If it works out, this would be Coca-Cola’s second major acquisition within months outside of its core soft drinks business."
14,2018-10-26,Nestle,"The anti-profiteering body under the goods and services tax framework is seeking details on pricing strategies from consumer goods companies and over-the-counter (OTC) drug makers to check whether they have passed on the benefits of reduced GST rates to consumers.

“The focus is on sectors that directly impact the consumers, like FMCG, pharma and real estate,” said a person with direct knowledge of the matter.

“Letters seeking details were issued to at least 50 companies in last week alone, and sales heads of these companies were asked to give details of their cost accounting,” the person said. In the past, some companies, including Patanjali Ayurved, Hindustan Unilever (HUL), Procter & Gamble (P&G), Nestle and Hardcastle Restaurants, had been either slapped with a fine or questioned for apparently failing to pass on the benefits of a tax rate reduction to consumers.

Industry insiders said many companies are finding it difficult to first calculate the amount of benefits accrued due to GST.

In some cases, they said, companies had offered discounts on old stocks when GST was introduced. These discounts were later discontinued. Hence there was not much difference in retail prices when GST rates were cut, they said.

“Calculating how much benefits should be passed on to customers due to GST is proving difficult for several companies as in some cases discounts were being offered on products which were merely discontinued and due to which prices remained unchanged,” said Sachin Menon, national head, indirect tax, at KPMG India. “Also there are different views on whether companies can pass on the benefits in kind — that is, increase the grammage,” he said.

Many companies, including some of the biggest FMCG and pharma players, claim that while they had passed on the benefits of GST, often the retailer or wholesaler had not done so.

“Elongated supply chains spanning across manufacturers, distributors, wholesalers, retailers, modern trade, etc. make it difficult for manufacturers to ensure that the benefits of rate reductions are passed on in respect of pipeline stock to consumers,” said M S Mani, partner at Deloitte India.

16,2018-10-29,Nestle,"This is the best buying opportunity in over two years and investors should come in and buy, Sandeep Bhatia, 
  
  
  Head of India Equities, Macquarie Capital Securities, tells ET Now. Bhatia expects earnings growth to come back in the banks first, followed by consumption and manufacturing especially auto ancillaries. These are expected to take the market forward from here.Edited excerpts: 

We have seen a raft-up outflow by foreign institutional investors, the highest in last 10 years. The outflow from Indian equities in October is north of $2.5 billion. What is causing this kind of panic because similar outflows happened in 2008 and this is certainly not 2008?
Of course, this is not 2008. This is nowhere close to the difficult times of 2008 but I would say that the US bond yields are the key focus for not only India but also for emerging markets across the globe. Therefore, we will continue to see outflows come through because US growth still continues to surprise on the upside. 

The US bond trajectory rates are still going up. We will see asset allocation move away from emerging markets and from India and outflows will continue for the next couple of months. We are getting into the election season and there is an element of political uncertainty that is adding to the pressures on FIIs flows. 


How should one look at it? Could this be the big turn in favour of emerging markets or do EMs have potential to fall further as the pain in developed market has just surfaced?
Emerging markets move on the back of strong global economic growth and specifically strong US growth. If the US growth continues to be broadly strong, that is a good earnings environment for all emerging markets and good GDP growth environment for the entire globe. This is the kind of environment that we are in. 

What is happening in the US is, in addition to good GDP growth, employment is also peaking. There is wage pressure coming through and therefore the Fed is moving towards raising interest rates and pushing down and controlling inflation that could be incipient in the economy. We are in that transition phase where this entire US rate curve, which has been very low for almost a decade after 2009 onwards, are now seeing the uptick come through. The impact will be felt by the entire global market. 

I would think this is a very healthy and required correction. I would expect the valuation correction to continue for some more time but earnings will hold up. We have to go through this phase in the next three to six months when the election season is ahead of us and then the market will be positioned for good buying opportunity from the first quarter of next year onwards.


How do you tie the earnings potential as the rates are edging higher? The government and RBI are at loggerheads on how to manage growth versus inflation. What are you factoring in your earnings assumption?
Earnings growth is coming from a variety of sectors and not only from the consumer discretionary space. We have seen earnings come through in commodity and IT companies and also banks. Banks are, in fact, the largest contributor to earnings. It is not that earnings pressure will come through just because there is some rate pressure coming in.

As far as the face-off between RBI and the government is concerned, I have seen that happen multiple times in the last 10-15-20 years across various governments. Clearly, there are pressures on the RBI. The RBI has actually done a fantastic job across-the-board, not only among emerging markets. I would not get too scared because by some of the headline that have come out over the weekend. I would think that earnings growth trajectory will come through from wider variety of sectors than what we have seen in the past three to four years. This is why earnings are not disappointing. 

When earnings are concentrated in one or two sectors, that’s when disappointments are likely to take place. The good thing about earnings story now is that it is going to come through from a wider variety of sectors and that is why we are more confident of earnings growth getting delivered despite some of the headwinds that you just referred to.


The shake-up in the market has really been about this big IL&FS fallout. Do you think NBFCs will continue to be affected over a longer period because of high cost of funding or is much of the pain already behind us?
There are various kinds of NBFCs. There are NBFCs which do a whole host of businesses and who have some aggressive lending practices and therefore those kinds of NBFCs are clearly feeling the brunt of the valuation correction and the money market drying up. 

There are some NBFCs which are much more focussed. They have higher quality books and a longer track record of doing business. Whether they are consumer focused or housing finance-focused, they have very good books and these NBFCs have reason to continue without making major changes to the balance sheet. 

But clearly, there is going to be a compression in the NBFC space. The growth in the bank lending which has not been there for the last four years, gave a very good environment combined with valuations of NBFCs which were going up. This created the hope that NBFCs can continue to grow at the rate at which it has grown. I would say that the 30% plus growth in NBFCs as a whole across the top tier or the bottom tier, that we have seen, is clearly not going to happen. There will be much more differentiated growth. 

Even in the banks’ side, it is not that every bank grows at the same rate or each bank is valued at very high multiples. More discrimination and differentiation will come through in the NBFCs going forward which is something that is required. Also some of the problems that you mentioned like IL&FS have come to the fore in the last three months, but these problems have been in the making for at least five to 10 years and therefore this is the last leg of the cleanup of the Indian financial system. 

The Indian financial system was clogged up with bad assets. The cleaning up happened both in the private sector as well as the public sector banks. We have seen management changes taking place in some large private sector banks. This is the last leg of the cleanup in the finance sector and that was very much required. 

The market will learn to differentiate and also learn a lesson that hopefully, it should not forget in the next upmove. This correction should continue for the next couple of months, maybe more than six months. We will then be positioned for a stronger, more secure and widespread sectoral growth of earnings coming through in the market.


Do you sense that there could be newer sectoral leadership that will take the markets forward from here?
The first place where earnings growth will come through is in the banking sector. The financials are the largest contributors to earnings. They will see earnings growth. If the trajectory of oil prices moderate even a bit, growth will come through even for the oil refining sectors. More importantly, we definitely see earnings growth coming through in the consumption space. We have seen ITC, Nestle and Unilever come out with good numbers. 

Broad consumption remains on track. Even in the manufacturing sector, large companies will see earnings growth coming through. We like Crompton Greaves, Maruti. In the recent correction, some of these companies have come through. Auto ancillaries have seen a correction. So. Motherson Sumi looks interesting at these levels. Across the board, we will see contribution coming through from various sectors of the economy but it will be led by the banks.


You have given an overarching view on the banks as well as NBFCs. ICICI Bank is your top pick among corporate lenders. Why?
ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank are the two large banking franchises in the private sector that we have. ICICI Bank trades at a significant discount with all the bad news which has come through in the last 12 to 36 months on the balance sheet, on the management changes and so on.

If you look at the various subsidiaries of ICICI Bank, we forget that it has market leading positions not only in the banking sector but its’ AMC business, insurance business are very large and profitable businesses on their own. 

Clearly, ICICI Bank is a strong franchise and from current levels, it is a fantastic two to three-year growth story which is coming through. The new management is focussed on delivering that. So, ICICI Bank remains our top pick.


What is your take on the so-called crowded auto names? Maruti, Eicher stocks are typically owned by institutional investors. But of late, there has been a serious price erosion. Maruti has come down from Rs 10,000 to Rs 6500, Eicher has come down from Rs 33,000 to Rs 24,000-25,000.
We have not made any major change in the earnings projections. At the margin, the overvaluation which has happened in certain concentrated names, has got corrected. We have seen price corrections happening in all the consumer discretionary and even consumption staple plays. 

That kind of price correction was necessary because there was clearly just one or two sectors which were doing well and now we are seeing a wider spread of sectors come through as these names have corrected. At the current levels, both Maruti and Eicher are very interesting. Both will offer you at least 18-20% earnings growth, both have interesting positions. 

Maruti is the default car purchase for most newcomers to the car fold and even existing users. Eicher is a proposition on the expansion of the two-wheeler market and the upgradation which is happening. So, both these businesses from current levels are definitely good two to three-year stories.


As a house, Macquarie champions tracking commodities globally. Indian commodity companies have got a huge blessing in disguise because of a weak dollar. Their earnings are likely to go higher because it is dollar denominated. How come markets are not taking notice of that?
Markets will take notice of things, it is not that they will notice something right at the moment that one wants it to. That is why there is a buying opportunity or a selling opportunity. Market notices there was a big pain in the financial sector and the banks were getting hit. At that point in time, market was ignoring the problems which were building in the NBFC sector and in the last two months, we have seen that come under intense focus. 

So the market moves from one story to the other and it sometimes gets into a phase where the positives are marked up significantly more than they should be and negatives are marked down more than they should be. We are in a phase where these corrections have happened and to that extent, what we are seeing in India is good valuations coming through, wider sectors coming through and earnings coming through across a whole range of sectors. 

If we look at it in the next six months, it is probably the best buying opportunity you will have over two years and investors should come in and buy at this moment."
1,2018-11-20,Nestle,"We are buying one of the two-wheeler companies in some of our client’s portfolios says Saurabh Mukherjea, Founder & Chief Investment Officer, Marcellus Investment. Mukherjea also says getting high teens to low 20s returns consistently by buying great compounders is very doable in India. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


There is every reason why one should not buy telecom stocks. In the next 10 minutes, we can find 15 reasons why one should not buy telecom stocks yet Bharti is at a 52-week high. What is going on?I guess there are probably enough people out there who are hoping that that the industry consolidates around two players and Bharti benefits from that from being one of those two players. I do not see any other logical way to understand this other than the fact that a number of investors out there are making a punt that they are in a two-player industry. Bharti will get its fair share of spoils. I cannot give you anything more substantive than that, I am afraid.


Can we imagine our life without power? The answer to that is no. But have shareholders of power companies made money? The answer is “no,” at least in India. Do you think telecom is like power? You need telecom but for minority shareholders, telecom companies will struggle now?Most regulated industries in India are similar -- whether you look at airlines, telecoms, power, infrastructure or real estate. Wherever the regulatory construct is such that the regulator or the government calls the shorts in terms of who gets in, who stays out and what are the rules of the game, it is very difficult for minority shareholders to make any money. That is the rule of thumb I followed in my 11 years in India -- stay away from sectors where the government or the regulator determines the rules of engagement. In such a sector, it is very difficult for minority shareholders to make money be that telecom, power, real estate or airlines.


ETNOW sources seem to be indicating that today the cabinet is going to decide on disinvestment in BPCL, Concor and SCI. Earlier also, the finance minister had indicated that disinvestment process is going to come to a close and she hopes to close in on that by the financial year end. Would you say though that the best is already in the price somewhat?I am not so sure how easy it will be to make money from high quality privatisation plays such as BPCL and Concor. Both are actually very good quality assets but I am not so sure how easy it will be for minority shareholders to make a punt on them and make money. What is more encouraging, what is more upbeat for the generally is that the government is clearly saying that in the next 6-8 months, we will move towards privatisation or large stake sales. That is probably the most bullish step forward towards privatisation we have seen in 14-15 years. The last major privatisation was made by NDA-1, a good 20 years ago. Beyond the stock specifics, this momentum in selling class assets is very encouraging for the market as a whole.


Given the degree of underlying uncertainty in the economy, we are looking for companies where we know with a very high degree of certainty that the books are clean and the numbers are real.-Saurabh Mukherjea


What is the overarching theme that you are going with in the current environment? Is it domestic focussed names, is it valuation? Given the degree of underlying uncertainty in the economy, we are looking for companies where we know with a very high degree of certainty that the books are clean and the numbers are real. 

Secondly, we look for companies where the products are as close as is possible to be essential for day-to-day life in India. We are trying to avoid companies where the product or the purchase is discretionary in nature. 

Third thing is barriers to entry. Clean accounts, essential products are very good to have but you need to have barriers to entry to make sure competition does not come and take your profits away. And when we find such companies we go and buy as proactively as we can without losing sleep on what was the PE multiple yesterday morning, what it will be tomorrow morning. We found in India around 20 such stocks; half are already in our portfolio and hopefully in the next year or so, we might find a couple of more stocks like this. 

As and when the economic environment becomes less hostile, we might become a little bit more adventurous in our stock picking. Over the last couple of years, it has been very tightly defined mantra, clean accounts, essential products, very high barriers to entry.


Sunil Singhania said buying a good business and buying a good stock are two different things. D-Mart is a great company, Indigo is a great company, a classic compounder which you own. Something like Aventis is a great company but if you are buying them at PE multiples of 50, 60, 70, the chances of making double digit returns for next three years are very rare. Do you think those classic compounders which you like and which are based on previous history, return ratios, ROE and ROC, they are outpriced right now?Sunil Singhania is a long-standing a guru, a friend, I have learnt from him in the years to come and we hope to learn a lot from him in the years to come. I learnt from him two years ago as to how to think about setting up an independent asset management business. Sunil is saying if you try to do what we are doing in India and try to do this in America, you will get slaughtered. 

In most efficient markets like the UK, USA, Germany and Japan, it is very difficult to maintain return on capital at 40% or even 30% over an extended period of time. Most glamorous well known American or Japanese firms will have return on capital of barely 15%. If they get to 15%, they will be celebrated on TV channels in America, on the covers of magazines and so on. 

Our country is unique amongst the world’s 10 largest economies in that we are the only large economy which has around 20-25 companies whose ROC is a million miles above their cost to capital for decades on end. When we say million miles, I am saying 40% ROC for a very extended period of time. If you can keep return on capital so far above the cost to capital for an extended period of time, it gives you a mountain of free cash flow and if you keep reinvesting that money in the business (as we have seen in India over the last five, 10, 20 years and even last year), you get a very high chance of keeping earnings growth around 20%-25% mark.

If we take one example of the several in our portfolio, this is exactly what Asian Paints has done for the last 30 years. Asian Paints 20 years ago was trading at exactly the same PE multiple. Asian Paints over the last 20 years has given close to 100 times returns. Nestle 20 years ago was trading at pretty close to the same multiple. Nestle over the last 20 years has given close to 80-90 times your money back. I do not know about the next three weeks or next three months, but I am pretty confident that if we carry on focussing on this type of company with very high barriers to entry, with return on capital being well above the cost to capital, we chug back plenty of free cash flow into the business. Whether you are Asian Paints, Pidilite or Dr Lal Path Labs, you reinvest the free cash flow back into the business. 

In a poor country like ours, the growth potential is immense. Even in a downturn, you are seeing these companies -- Asian Paints, Dr Lal Path Labs and even Page Industries -- which is a big part of our portfolio, give you volume growth between 9% and 19%. That gives you a sense of how far we have to go in terms of development to our country. 

PE-based investing has a big place in everybody’s portfolio. In the west, PE-based investing, value investing as it is better known as, is the definitive way to manage money by and large. It works in India as well. There is a small set of companies in our country which are able to keep return on capital very high and thus earnings growth is very high and if there you invest even at 100 times PE shown over the last three years and in my books I have shown over the last 20 years you still make very healthy returns, high teens, low 20s returns. 

If I make high teens, low 20s returns for our clients consistently, that is a pretty decent outcome for them. We are not claiming we can do 30-40% return by timing the market or by getting the PE multiples right, but high teens to low 20s consistently by buying great compounders is very doable in India.


You are completely staying away from power, metals, real estate pockets. If we do see an overall pullback which we have already started to see when it comes to the market regardless of the fundamentals or growth indicators, do you see more participation across the board?The most interesting one will be auto and as we all know October has been a pretty decent month for the auto sector where everybody is trying to figure out whether October is the beginning of the auto revival or whether it is a flash in the pan. What we have started to do in some of our client’s portfolio is, selectively buy one of the two-wheeler companies. I am not at liberty to disclose the name but we are buying one of the two-wheeler companies in some of our client’s portfolios not because we expect the two-wheeler revival to have begun a month ago and from now on it will grow, but given the quality of the franchise, the high ROCs, high cash generation the sheer quality of the corporate governance, we felt that the two-wheeler company was just too deliciously cheap to be ignored. 

We will see if the two-wheeler company carries on showing us that even with low volume growth they can hold up their business, you might buy some more. I am not so sure cars and trucks are going to recover quite as quickly as two-wheelers. I think two-wheelers are likely to recover quicker than cars and trucks because their ticket sizes or purchase are smaller. But this is probably the biggest sector if one wanted to play a potential economic recovery. More than cement, steel or real estate, two-wheelers and the auto would be the industry to look at. There are several good auto ancillaries which are absolutely smashed in terms of valuation. Again, these are cash generative companies with strong balance sheets. So, auto, auto ancillaries would be my favourite play on economic recovery as and when we get visibility on that."
2,2018-11-20,Nestle,"After the threat of organic products from Baba Ramdev-led Patanjali Ayurved, government regulations have the potential to act as another external factor prompting fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies to change. Proposed bans on single-use plastic and on sale of junk foods in school canteens are likely to push companies back to their war rooms to rejig their product portfolios to make them healthier, reduce dependency on plastic and re-strategise their communication.

The Centre has planned to phase out single-use plastics by 2022. Several states, meanwhile, have varyingly banned single-use plastic products. The Food and Standards Authority of India issued draft regulations earlier this month on banning sale as well as advertisements of junk foods (highly fatty and salty foods) in school. Under its ‘Eat Right Movement’, the regulator had last year asked the food and beverage industry to voluntarily reduce salt, sugar and saturated fat in packaged foods. The nudge is now slated to turn into a push.

Consumers are turning more health and environment conscious and such regulatory push is a natural extension of this. FMCG companies, with their predominant use of plastic packaging and packaged food products with high content of salt, sugar and fats have a reason to worry.

The thrust of Patanjali Ayurved on natural and organic products was lapped up by consumers, a trend that gave mainstream FMCG companies a run for their money in the recent past. However, after the initial stress, the companies were able to tide over the threat of competition by introducing natural variants of their products or acquiring herbal or ayurvedic products to complete their portfolios.

Thanks to their global parents, multinational companies such as HUL and Nestle have been agile in knowing which way the wind is blowing now. ITC, with its strong compliance of ESG (environmental, social and governance) norms, too has taken proactive measures.

For HUL, its parent is leading the way. Unilever has announced that by 2025 it will halve its use of virgin plastic in its packaging by using more of recycled plastics and that it will collect and process more plastic packaging than it sells. Nestle too has chalked out measures to reduce the salt and sugar content in its product categories, along with adopting more environment-friendly packaging.

FMCG stocks are largely performing well on the bourses. For investors, companies that adopt a strong and discerning strategy to meet the regulations without compromising on the quality or taste will emerge the winners. Incidentally, the cost of making products healthier and plastic-free will be passed on to consumers as companies continue to premiumise their portfolio."

3,2018-11-20,Nestle,"SBI, Bank of Baroda, Canara Bank and PNB can give at least a 30% upside from present prices, says Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive V-P, IIFL Securities. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

On Aviation StocksThere has been a relative slowdown of the economy but a lot of it is getting addressed. The cost of money is definitely headed lower which means ease in travel and very lucrative rates maybe a thing of the past. Rates may start to head up. We have a buy on both the stocks on declines. There is regular bouts of profit booking which comes when IndiGo was Rs 1m750 and SpiceJet was Rs 145 . But again, these are the two listed companies. Personally, I prefer to travel by Vistara.

But on declines, this is a very consumer centric industry where 2020 should bode extremely well, given that we are very optimistic on the return of the consumer, the economy doing well and aviation as a conduit for that. 


On Telecom
Our clients have been laughing their way to the bank. We have been long on Bharti and Reliance as a disclosure and we are riding it. We think there is going to be a short term bout of profit booking which may last for two-three days but this is one sector which is going to bely most expectations. Most of the underpinnings are over. ARPUs are going to rise and we think there could be a fair package for both Vodafone and Bharti from the government.

We will work on that but we definitely think the government is going to give some relief. On the consumption side, you can see that we have been saying that ARPUs may have bottomed out and we thought that data is definitely going to get more expensive. A disclosure, Bharti, Reliance are two of our top picks. They continue to be in our portfolio and this week has been exceptionally strong for all investors who have held those shares on our account.

We are very positive on Sun, Lupin, Dr Reddy’s, Cipla and Glenmark. You can add a Divy’s there, but if you are a strategic investor, then SBI Pharma Fund and the Nippon Pharma Fund should be very, very good funds to do a SIP at least for the next six months.-Sanjiv Bhasin


On PSU Banks
The weaker or the most hated sectors -- telecom and PSU banks are bouncing back. The Supreme Court judgement on Essar Steel is a path breaking decision and the SBI chairman, smaller banks have said that write backs will be a part of the course as most of the provisioning is done. So, I am extremely positive on PSU banks. There is a Rs 70,000 crore of recapitalisation, which means almost 5.5 lakh crore of book will grow in the next three years.

We think you cannot go wrong given that yields are softening. They are awash with cash and they are going to definitely start the lending cycle on the retail side. So SBI continues to be our top pick. Along with that, Bank of Baroda, Canara Bank and PNB can give you at least a 30% upside from present prices. 2020 may actually see PSU banks lead from the front


On Divestment 
The divestment candidates like Concor, BPCL & SCI have moved up very smartly.We think this is going to be a path breaking reform by the government. Strategic selloff last happened in 1999 and after that there has been a total hiatus. The government has decided that they have no business to be in business and that is a very positive move.

BPCL, Concor and SCI should set the cat amongst the pigeons. We are extremely positive. I think the valuations they will get will also be fairly impressive, given that all three businesses are monopolies. We have to see in the next three months, how fast the divestment takes place. The finance minister has already indicated that they should be done with it before March and it should see re-rating of the entire PSU basket. 

The government has the intension to bring down their holding to 26% in a lot of other companies like IOC and BHEL. These are all very good entry points because the unlocking of value will be huge as and when it takes place.


On Pharma Stocks
Pharma has been a very big underperformer. This is just about time where smart money is seeing rotation. By the way, pharma numbers, particularly the likes of Glenmark were very smart looking and now people have realised that pharma has consolidated enough and the worries of the FDA issues are now going to be on the backburner. Plus, generic pricing in the US may be back and they are spreading in geographies across the world. The local businesses for all of them have looked up so we are very positive on Sun, Lupin, Dr Reddy’s, Cipla and Glenmark. You can add a Divy’s there, but if you are a strategic investor, then SBI Pharma Fund and the Nippon Pharma Fund should be very, very good funds to do a SIP at least for the next six months. 2020 could see pharma hugely outperform as a sector.


On Trends in Consumption SpaceThere are three parts. Firstly, these stocks have been the prime of most of the mutual fund portfolios. Nestle, Lever, Colgate and Asian Paints have taken the cake, even though numbers were not that sparkling. But they have been very expensive stocks and have been getting more expensive. For us, the game changer is these two three events which the government has done -- corporate tax cut, strategic disinvestment. The pass through effect of money where the mistrust is now getting allayed and you should see much easier pass through of money from banks as PSU banks start to lend very actively on all three -- discretionary, staples and durables. 

The broader basket will definitely outperform. We are not making a case for Nestle or Lever at these prices. We think in fact if the Nifty sustains over 12,000 and if we hit new highs which is just round the corner, then the broader market consumption should do extremely well. That means discretionaries like auto and select other FMCG stocks could be outperformers in 2020."

8,2018-11-25,Nestle,"NEW DELHI: Positive developments on the US-China trade war front and Sensex rejig were among the key reasons for a rally in domestic equity market.

BSE benchmark Sensex jumped 470 points to trade at 40,829. The index also hit a new lifetime high of 40,857.73 during the day. Its NSE counterpart Nifty soared 141 points to 12,056.

Metal stocks jumped as Tata Steel added 4.83 per cent to RS 418.90 while Vedanta was up 2.81 per cent to Rs 146.15 on BSE. BSE Metal index gained 3.13 per cent to 9,670.77.

Among other Sensex gainers were Bharti Airtel up 5.7 per cent to Rs 444.95 and IndusInd Bank up 2.6 per cent to Rs 1,484. HDFC was the biggest index contributor with 91 points.

Key factors behind the rally: 


Trade deal by year-end?

Sentiments improved on Dalal Street after reports said the US and China could sign a deal before the year ends. A senior US official over the weekend said an initial trade agreement is still possible by the end of the year, after Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump both underscored their desire on Friday to sign a deal.

The prolonged trade war between the world’s leading economies have been weighing on the market and economies. The resolution of the conflict may boost growth.


Laggards out of Sensex

BSE on Friday announced some changes to the composition of its flagship Sensex. The exchange has decided to remove Tata Motors, Tata Motors DVR, YES Bank and Vedanta from the index to make space for UltraTech Cement, Titan and Nestle India. This will be effective from December 23.

YES Bank has been one of the biggest disappointments in recent months as far as the stock market performance is concerned. It has dived 65 per cent year-to-date. SImilarly, Tata Motors is down 4 per cent YTD, Tata Motors DVR (17.9 per cent) and Vedanta (28 per cent) in comparison of 13 per cent gain in Sensex.


FPIs bullish on India

Foreign investors poured over Rs 5,000 crore into the Indian equity market on Friday, as per data available on NSDL. Net inflows in the last week was at Rs 2,683.96 crore. Overall, FIIs have largely been bullish on the Indian market in November, investing Rs 17,548 crore.


Asian markets

A cautious rally in Asian markets also buoyed domestic stocks. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan bounced 0.7 per cent, after losing 0.4 per cent last week. Japan's Nikkei firmed 0.7 per cent, while Australian stocks rose 0.5 per cent and Shanghai blue chips 0.3 per cent. Heng Seng also gained1.5 per cent. Most European markets also opened with gains. FTSE added 0.7 per cent while CAC gained 0.6 per cent and DAX was up 0.5 per cent. 


Technical factor

Nifty50 appears to have embarked on a fresh leg of rally as it erased the last two sessions of losses witnessed from the highs of 12,038-11,883 levels in just one stroke, said Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in.

Hence, sustaining above 11,919 it should ideally test its life time highs placed around 12103. But beyond that in best case scenarios we can expect a target of 12350-400 levels. One can continue to retain a positive outlook as long as Nifty sustains above 11919 levels which can be ideal stop for fresh long positions on closing basis."

12,2018-11-26,Nestle,"Foreigners have brought in more money and the rally has started. Some corrections cannot be ruled out because valuations have started scaling up. In that correction, stay with good quality stocks, says Deven R Choksey, MD, KR Choksey Investment Managers. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.



Whether you call this a Santa rally or picking up from where we left off, we took maybe two to three weeks off in the middle. Now it looks like market momentum is intact. What are you making of it?I stay selective in my investment portfolio. I do agree that the current rally is largely propelled by the liquidity coming in from the global side and that too in select few stocks, where they matter most as far as the index is concerned. It is not across the board. Though definitely one would argue that in the respective sectors, selective stocks have started performing well in this particular rally, it is a good sign that it is merit driven. 

Now whether it will come off in a hurry, I do not know. My reading says that we are heading for relatively better times. Everybody wants to look forward to US and India signing some kind of trade treaty, wherein Indian exports would start looking up. That could signal probably a larger level of interest as far as the global investors are concerned into our market.

I guess the foreigners have brought in more money and the rally has started. Maybe some corrections cannot be ruled out because the valuations have started scaling up. In that correction, my recommendation would be to stay with good quality stocks and corrective downside should be bought into in building the portfolio henceforth. We remain relatively confident about the market momentum on the upside for next year. Our bet would be on quality stocks.


What has been your big acquisition in October-November, where have you added a substantial amount of weight to your portfolio?We saw some amount of downside in HDFC and that gives us relatively more confidence to buy further into the stock. The company has a housing loan book which is probably one of the best in the industry. At the same time, the investments into the listed companies within the group including the bank AMC, the life insurance companies and also some of the yet to monetise businesses like Ergo are there. 

Among them, a few NBFCs from education companies, particularly NBFC side is among the themes which we picked up. We felt that this is one area where we could remain relatively safe in adding into the portfolio. We continue to add more weight into Reliance largely because we believe that consumer facing businesses -- Jio and retail would eventually get monetised. That is where unlocking of the valuation would take place and the benefit would go to the investors and shareholders. 

These are the areas where we have stayed focussed. We have not added midcaps and smallcaps. However, we like some of them and continue to hold them. We feel the larger ones would become bigger and they are going to create much bigger opportunity going forward. That is the theme that we are following currently.


It is a print of new all-time high on the Nifty. The global markets are also at an all-time high, as are we. Is it the start and the end of the story that there is nothing special about India? Last one month NASDAQ is up 4%, we are also 4% up. Should we stop complaining about the slowdown?Globally, few things are probably propelling this rally in equity. One of them is definitely the important aspect that the rate of interest is historically low in most of the countries. 


We have not added midcaps and smallcaps. However, we like some of them and continue to hold them.-Deven R Choksey
As a result, the funds had shifted to long-term asset growth like equity. That is one definite allocation perspective that one brings in. The second most important perspective that one brings in is that America and China are settling the trade row and as a result, prospects are brightening.

2020 is being seen as a year wherein we are likely to see relatively stable trade as a result of which, investors once again come back to the market with higher allocation of funds. Coming to India, in October and November, we have been seeing a good flow of money from FIIs. That is also propelling this particularly rally. 

From the indices’ perspective per se, some of the larger weight stocks are basically driving this rally. Reliance is one among them. Even a telecom company like Bharti Airtel is among them. At the same time, the HDFC and Bajaj twins are basically driving the markets and the indices up. The overweight of some of these stocks is basically driving the indices up. Overall, the midcaps and smallcap are still languishing. In select stocks, we have been seeing the buying coming from select corners but otherwise, markets are looking relatively stable. 


Yesterday we broke the story on government considering one-time rollover of debts. . Do you think a move like this could help ease the problems for the real estate space?It is a very positive move on structural side. This is where you are likely to see stress. Real assets are getting the breathing space and more money would come in to buy some of the properties which these realty companies particularly have been nurturing for some time. My reading says that if this activity gains momentum, probably we would be seeing a very strong emergence of paper use model and that is going to probably revive the real estate market.

Currently, real estate businesses are becoming prohibitively expensive for consumer and that is where the financers’ role is going to be very important. With the kind of structured vehicle that the government has built, it is going to have the potential of inviting more money into the system, particularly from the global side. We remain relatively confident about it. I do not know which company would get immediate benefits, but strong companies with good properties would probably have a better outlook to talk about going forward. 


You mentioned Reliance and of course that has been in focus. Let us also take a look at the telecom angle at some of the other teleco names, Bharti in particular. We have been going through some trends and the kind of move that it has made, is really standing out. What is your perspective on Bharti?The moratorium on AGR is going to help Bharti along with the other companies in the telecom sector. So, that creates a breathing space. At the same time, tariff is going up from 1st December. That is likely to spell out good news as far as the working of the company is concerned. 

If I am right, we could possibly see around 20-25% increase in the tariff. You could see a similar contribution coming into the EBITDA of the company. I think these are two positive news that I see. Alongside, there is one challenge and that is a challenge of putting in the 5G related bandwidth and the infrastructure in the business. So, that will need more capital and so capital infusion will have to take place. That is one challenge which one will have to look out for.

Otherwise, in current times, the stock probably he has been experiencing buying also because of the fact that I think in last few years telecom story was sounded negative now I think it is slightly stable comparatively so that is why I think you are seeing the Bharti going up. I do not think that I think the company’s financial ratios would change big time from here. They continue to operate in the single digit of ROC. That will not be changing beyond a point, even though an increase in tariff will take place, given the kind of pressure that they would have on the expansion side.


We have often debated about whether or not quality is overpriced. Has the time now come to ease off from some of these blue chip names? Would you believe that Nestle has a problem ahead because of the slowdown in the milk market?Well not as much honestly, if I start looking at the overall composition of the market and the purchasing power therein. Most of the FMCG companies are sitting on the brilliant prospect of finding themselves in a better position because of greater purchasing power in the hands of consumers, particularly the rural ones. We are definitely expecting to see more money in the hands of people, largely because of the rollout of the projects by the government and infrastructure projects.

At the same time, the favourable monsoon and the resultant outcome on the crops would spell out better times for the rural economy. Going forward, the FMCG company and food sector in particular should be in a favourable position. Having said that on the prospect side, companies and their valuations have always been challenging. They have been quoting at a premium.

If you buy any of the FMCG companies, they have probably priced in things for next two years. You should not be expecting any return out of them. On the contrary. you should be buying these companies if you want to have them in the portfolio, by doing an SIP into this kind of stocks. You are never going to get it cheaper and at the same time at least two years of prices are discounted fully at the current price level. The same story holds true for companies like Nestle, Britannia and many other companies in the FMCG basket. These are expensive but they have better prospects going forward."

14,2018-11-27,Nestle,"Rather than looking at largecaps or midcaps as a basket, it is a very stock specific market, says Pankaj Pandey, Head Research, ICICIdirect.com. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


How should one read into the YES Bank news? Three months ago, there was a big question mark on whether the bank would survive or not. But if they indeed raise capital, they will survive. The problem is that the stock today is in F&O band. What should one do?We would expect some bit of short covering on YES Bank, but from a fundamental perspective we have not really rated the stock because the stock is under review. Earlier we had a reduce rating on the stock. Our sense is that beyond $1.2 billion, the bank would need more funds and that would lead to good amount of dilutions. Till the time you do not have clarity in terms of the extent of funds being raised, we would not be chasing this stock structurally. From a shorter-term perspective, a bit of short covering can drive the stock performance.


According to Citibank today the divergence between largecap stocks and midcap stocks now is at a historic high. Could it remain like this for a long time? After midcap stocks started correcting in 2009, they came back in fashion only in 2013. As of now, midcap stocks have only corrected for two-two and a half years. Are we in for a long winter for mid and small cap stocks?Rather than looking at largecaps or midcaps as a basket, it is a very stock specific market. The index multiple is going up because the index has high multiple PE stocks. So, again it is a very stock specific market. We have seen cracks in largecaps also. We have seen very good performance from tier one companies and same is the case with even midcaps and smallcaps. My sense is wherever there is comfort on growth, the market has been giving robust multiples to a number of companies -- be it largecap, midcap or smallcap. 

For example, ITC still does not show growth but the market is giving it a multiple of 19 times. Nestle has had at least 9% growth, and the market has been giving it multiples in excess of 50 times. So, rather than slicing it between largecaps and midcaps, it is better to slice basis growth.


Coming to pharma stocks, we have seen a decent buying interest in select names from Dr Reddy’s to Glenmark and even Aurobindo Pharma despite the overhang. Are there any select pharma stocks that you are looking at?The market is not comfortable with stocks which have got higher exposure on the US market, especially in the case of Aurobindo Pharma. The share of the US market to their business is going to go up to about 58 odd per cent. That is why the stock is trading at 8 to 9 multiple. Other players like Dr Reddy’s are panning out better largely because they are looking to diversify their geographies. 

Domestically, hospitals have done fairly well in the last quarter and their EBITDA margin is improving. Given that the capex is behind us, we also like the MNC pharma companies which have got higher domestic exposure. Growth certainty is definitely there along with some of the companies are witnessing good amount of margin expansion. Take for example Pfizer. It witnessed about 400 bps kind of margin expansion and which is why even some of these MNC names are trading 40 times, their current earnings even slightly more than that. Wherever we are getting any comfort in terms of stable growth, those are the stocks one has to chase.


What have you made of the recent run-up in some of the metal names? Would that be a pocket you would be willing to look at or you would still be averse to?In metals, this rally has been largely driven by the idea that the US and China are going to strike a deal. We think some bit of technical bounce can be expected. But then, the structural issue of demand supply in balance globally is still sort of persisting and that is where we see challenges. 


Within tier I names, we like Tech Mahindra more, given the fact that the deal wins have been pretty good in the last quarter.-Pankaj Pandey
Domestically, we expect that the inventory correction has happened and you have seen raw material prices correcting. So EBITDA per tonne is likely to improve for some of the players but then one should not be overtly bullish on a number of these names. We still have a good amount of clouds and we would not expect much performance. This rally does not have too many legs.


Does one look at Zee in a new light altogether now?The only positive in Zee is that you will not see pledged shares coming into the market. But there is the overhang of related party transactions. I guess the amount is about Rs 700 odd crore which is what the company had given to launch Dish TV. That remains a challenge because Dish TV itself is stressed. This is a key overhang and which is why we have turned neutral on the stock. Till the time that gets resolved, we would not expect a rerating to happen. Recently, what we have seen is that even the growth has come down because of the overall slowdown that we have witnessed in the economy. Till the time, related party transactions get resolved, we will not be turning positive on the stock.


Do you feel that perhaps now we might see a catch up and if so, which are the select names within the IT pack? Would you be looking at Wipro or Infosys to lead the way forward?In IT, the growth has been on expected lines. There is not much of positive surprise to look at on IT side. But within tier I names, we like Tech Mahindra more, given the fact that the deal wins have been pretty good in the last quarter. That is something which we like at this point in time. 


How should pharma be approached? After the US FDA booster for Biocon, is there merit in the stock?We like the entire Biocon story. In H1, they made revenues of about $140 million on biologics and they have got about 28 products in the pipeline and are confident of achieving a billion dollar revenue by FY22. Given the capex the company has been doing and the initial success it has seen, we have a target price of Rs 310. Within the tier I pharma names, Biocon clearly stands out. Their subsidiary Syngene is also doing quite well. We are quite positive on this stock. 

Largely we are more positive on the domestic oriented names whether it is Torrent Pharma which has got a higher share of domestic revenues or the MNC names or even the hospitals, wherein we are seeing structural improvement in margins, given the fact that capex is over. We are not chasing companies which are pretty aggressive on the US market."

Let me start by sharing marvelous quotes from two investment greats.


Reversion to mean is the iron rule of the financial markets
-- John C Bogle

The safest and most potentially profitable thing is to buy something when no one likes it

- Howard Marks
Individually too, these are great quotes, but together, they are something else. If just these two pithy advices are followed, we need to read no voluminous treatise on investing, and we will do quite well as investors.

It is vital that we, as investors, know at what stage of the cycle a company and its stock price are. This applies to different market segments as well. Just a couple of years ago, there was a lot of optimism about midcap stocks. There were cases when investors had a disproportionately high share of their portfolios allocated to midcap stocks.

This happened simply because these stocks did very well in the preceding few years. Indeed, we still get many queries whether midcap stocks are better than largecaps in delivering alpha.


Agencies
The fact is, that over time, largecap and midcap indices have given almost the same returns, but they move in different trajectories.

The same swings in fortunes apply to sectors and individual stocks. It also applies to portfolio managers with different styles. Only the length of the cycle varies.

Just compare the long-term track records of different funds. Inevitably, they converge to a similar performance.

Why is this relevant? Investing in a stock, after it has risen substantially, and with the hope or belief that one can get out just before the slide sets in is one of the primary causes for investor heartburn.

When the market price suggests the level of optimism around a stock is substantial, it is better to stay away from it.

This rule applies to all companies, including the ones where the earnings momentum continues to be robust. As investors, apart from tracking the earnings trajectory of the company concerned, it is vital that we keep track of the entry price when we buy its shares.

For example, let us discuss one of the most well-known companies in the country: Infosys. Between 2000 and 2006, it grew earnings by 35.7 per cent compounded per annum. But during the same period, the stock rose only 4.2 per cent per annum.

The same Infosys grew earnings between 2017 and 2019 at 6.42% compounded per annum. But the stock price moved 16% compounded per annum in those years ending October 2019. (Source: ACE Equity).


Agencies
What is the crucial difference? The entry price in March 2000 was at a PE multiple of 208 times trailing earnings. In August, 2017, the entry price was at a trailing PE of 14 times.

Almost every sector and stock is subjected to this rule, including very well-known and popular names of the day.


Agencies

Agencies
Here is the history of PE multiples of Nestle India and Hindustan Unilever (HUL), two most popular names in the market today:



Nestle’s earnings growth was far ahead of price growth during 1994 and 2004. But since then, the stock price growth has far outstripped earnings growth. However, over the long term, there is a definite correlation between earnings growth and price growth.



HUL’s share price has exhibited a similar trajectory like that of Nestle in the past decade. However, in the long run, there is a definite correlation between earnings growth and price growth.


What are the implications for an investor?


Never overload your portfolio with a single type of stocks or a single type of mutual funds. Always diversify. This would help when the sector or stock reverts to mean.



It is okay, even desirable, to have some sectors or stocks (provided they have strong business models) that are down in the dumps. That way, all our investments need not go up and down together.



When one stock or sector is very popular today, it reflects the high level of expectation around that stock or sector. A very high expectation almost inevitably leads to disappointment. The key to making money is to buy good businesses when they are not popular and wait for them to turn popular. When they are unpopular, they aren’t expensive. And buying something inexpensive increases the chances of a profitable investment.

Just as we began with two great quotes, we shall end with another. Graham and Dodd’s immortal book Security Analysis begins with this quote from Horace, which we shall do well to remember always:


Many shall be restored that are now fallen, and many shall fall that are now in honor!

16,2018-11-28,Nestle,"Do not look at industry, look at dividend paying as a criteria for midcaps because that will qualify all the decent companies in the bucket and you can then pick and choose, says Ajay Srivastava, CEO, Dimensions Corporate Finance Services. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


It is raining dollars, approximately worth Rs 40,000 crore, in the last three months. With so much liquidity, bulls cannot put a foot wrong. I thought markets always followed earnings, macro and the long term economic outlook. Why are foreign investors blinded to what is happening in the real economy?It is important to understand that in economic text books, we never had a concept called negative interest rate. This is a concept where I give you money and take back less money after one year. This is an unheard of economic concept. When you unleash that kind of stuff on the global economy, you are bound to have people taking risks of all kinds. It does not matter anymore because even if you do nothing, but keep getting some dividend; even if you do nothing but get 1-2% return, you are good enough from that basis. 

We have seen this play out in a number of times. It is not the first time that the liquidity rally has played out. Unfortunately, India is different from the US and you are right in questioning this because compared to the US, where the economy is also doing extremely well, grounds up we are doing pretty badly. But the caveat is that though we could be doing very badly at the ground level, the top-tier companies have got a big largess in terms of tax. 

If you remember the finance minister’s speech yesterday, there is a reference to a dividend distribution tax. The next Budget might take off the dividend distribution tax and so the listed large corporates will definitely benefit from the economic policy and the FIIs are going in there. The fact that the rest of India wants to party with everybody else is a different matter, but the key is economic policies of the government, global flows are marching together and taking the index up. You ride it because the government is with you at this point of time.


Let us try and map it and track it to the top. What stocks could you bet on which will make you richer in say a year or two from now?I am a firm believer of the trodden path, I do not really venture into jungles and get lost. The last time we tried it was three years back. Believe me, we just managed to get out of the jungle alive -- small and midcap space. So, I would still stay on the trodden path. The government economic policies are very clearly saying that large private corporate banks will continue to benefit. 

We have a big power debt overhang on the nationalised bank and they may give you a little bit of fillip but eventually the chicken will come home to roost because power dues are going to turn into a big problem in the next 6-9 months. Nationalised banks are going to be an issue and the consumer and mudra loans will be written off again. Unless the nationalised banks are privatised and in which case you can buy it, I would say follow closely the path of the private banks. They are doing fine, they have a monopoly. 

Pharma sector which has underperformed for some time, is ready for a big jump because they sorted out a lot of US issues. The domestic industries are doing well and there is no sign of price control. Corporate tax rate is going to give them some benefit; if dividend distribution tax goes, that is going to be big benefit. 

The last one would be metals. That is also slated for a big bump because if the economy stabilises and growth returns, they are the first point where the demand has to come in. I would say, take the metal, pharma, and the private banking space. You are doing fine with your portfolio at this point of time.


How many more private banking names would you buy? Would you really touch a YES Bank and RBL right now? How much more of ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank would you hold in your portfolio?Okay two points; one, historically one does not buy returns at the peak, you buy risk at the peak. When you are investing big time, you are investing more on risk than return because it is a liquidity filled rally and has nothing to do with fundamentals. So, it may come to haunt you for a long time. The only benefit is that even if there is a steep correction in the market or whenever global liquidity starts to ebb, or we have a high inflation in India, you would find that they will be the last point standing in terms of these four-five institutions. 

If you were to be in this market, you got to be there because literally a telecom and four banks have a monopoly on the private sector space in India which is unprecedented in global industry at this point of time. You can keep buying safer, but we are buying risk at the end of the day. You might have to wait for the return longer, but let us not worry about whether they will be a buyer in those stocks because those have been tested in the last five, seven years. We have tested HDFC Bank and of course there is a leadership change which might change a lot of views about the bank, but so far on the fundamentals, we have had phenomenal returns on these banks. If you have stuck to Nestles and Levers of the world, you would have phenomenal returns. 

I would say do not worry about largecap surplus, do not add too much. It is a risk right now but don’t worry too much because these stocks can go a long way.


You will get returns in all sectors but metal would give you perhaps the best alpha returns as the economy turns around.-Ajay Srivastava

If one works with the assumption that recovery will happen -- be it at the end of this year or next year, as base has come down to a sub-5% GDP growth, where would the delta of recovery be higher? Would it be in consumption, autos, discretionary and durables or will it be in cyclicals, metals, cement or industrials? Which end of the market do you bet on?You are assuming that there is a direct connection between the state of the economy and the state of the capital markets. The state of the economy is nowhere in comparison to the state of the market and that is why those two issues have to be delinked. Large parts of India will suffer and is already suffering in terms of the economic progress, growth, employment, etc. 

But there will be a part of India which will benefit from the government policies and that is why we need to divorce sentimental thinking from low GDP numbers. The top 200 companies in the country are having a much better time with lack of competition and all other governance issues and all economies put together than perhaps ever in the history. The more the smaller shoemakers disappear, the more the Batas gain. The more the smaller condiment makers disappear, the more Nestle gains. 

Secondly, who gains from the cut in the tax rate? The answer is the top 200 companies. The smaller guys never paid the tax because they were anyway losing money. I would say fundamentally that you need to divorce the economic aspect from the capital market. They are too far apart at this point of time. And they may be playing out in political compulsions and the results in state assembly election, etc. We may not like it, but that is what it is. 

I believe today in terms of pure market, metals will be the outperformers at any point of time because given where they are today and the fact that most of them are debt-free at this point of time but at the low end of the earning cycle, with very low price to book, you just cannot go wrong in terms of doubling or tripling. Decent metals stocks will go at least to 1.5 to 2 times book value. Metal would be the first stage where we will get alpha returns in my view. You will get returns in all sectors but metal would give you perhaps the best alpha returns as the economy turns around.


Do you buy a pure India play like SAIL, a global interplay like Vedanta or a Europe plus India interplay like Tata Steel? It is a large sector and in India there are a variety of metal companies, ferrous and nonferrous. What would you bet on?We are already placing our bets on two places. One is the non-ferrous. There are only two or three companies and you really do not have too much choice in the non-ferrous. There is a Nalco, a Vedanta and that is about all. We have holdings in both. 

But steel could be a stunner because now steel is in very strong hands. All the players are in very strong hands. There is no need for discount in the market. The debt overhang is gone by and large from the sector. It should get some amount of government largesse in terms of orders or some concessions. 

Non-ferrous and steel in that order would be the better plays and as a pure India story, I do not bet on global stories because if I have to bet on global stories, I would go abroad and bet. I am not betting on metal overseas. I am betting local on India at this point of time because if any revival takes place, you need more aluminium windows, more steel, more iron railway tracks. You need all kind of stuff. Without that, it is not going to work for the India story. I would say non-ferrous first, steel second and local domestic at this point of time.


Given that valuation discount of midcaps is close to a 10-year high, does that present a compelling opportunity? What are the businesses you would be looking at within the midcaps?You have to focus on high dividend paying companies because those are the companies with steady businesses, low debt and ability to pay big amounts of money back to the shareholders. In fact. in some of the cases the returns are 7-8 and even 10%. 

So instead of looking at an industry pack, you need to look at the divided pack of midcaps and say if the company can pay 5-7-8% dividend consistently on strong cash flows and since there is no capex need for any company in the next year or two, that is the segment you can focus on. I would say, do not look at industry, look at dividend paying as a criteria for midcaps because that will qualify all the decent companies in the bucket and you can then pick and choose. 


Because midcap and dividend normally does not come together? Yes, you are right but this is a peculiar situation, where you find many midcaps giving dividend yields of 8-10% even at this point of time. That is why I said it is one of the peculiar times of life where midcaps are not borrowing, they are not doing capex.

By definition, Rs 500 crore, Rs 1000 crore companies can be midcaps because of SEBI definition. You will find that they are giving very attractive dividends at this point of time. Their share prices have fallen dramatically but the cash flows are very good at and they are mostly deleveraged or are in the process of deleveraging. 


I cannot find companies which are giving 8% dividend yield with market cap criteria of less than Rs 1000 crore. Maybe you have some different data, why don’t you educate us?We have got midcaps which are giving us yield of between 5-10%. Definitely we have got at least 8 to 10 of them in our portfolio at this point of time. I can tell you one off the cuff itself. If you look at HEG -- Rs 50 dividend, Rs 1,000 share price. It was Rs 950 share price not long back.


HEG must have given this dividend when they were in a bull run because there was a shortage of graphite electrodes. That was last year. It is like buying a commodity cycle when the year was great. The dividend was strong, may be that dividend would not come now?It has come this year. Earlier, these companies were leveraged. So, when they were getting into a cycle, they were over investing even at the peak of the cycle. Now, the midcap story is that they have enjoyed the peak of the cycle, they have deleveraged themselves, not invested too much capex in the market and therefore are able to come out smiling at the end of the day. 

That is why I said there is a qualitative difference in the top 200 midcaps which have not invested at the peak of the cycle, but used the cash flows to deleverage themselves and clean the books of the company. Take REC for instance. I would call it a midcap. It’s dividend is upwards of 8-10% if I am not wrong. Portfolio may go wrong in the next two years or so, but the dividend has been extremely strong."

18,2018-11-30,Nestle,"MUMBAI: To de-tangle growth from the grip of a slowdown, fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies are redefining their product and marketing strategies, depending on their stage of evolution.

Hindustan Unilever (HUL), which is already well entrenched in both urban and rural India, has maintained its strategy of straddling the pyramid. Urban-centric company L’Oreal, on the other hand, is looking at a more premium play and has put the sachet strategy on the back-burner. There are some like Nestle India that have a greater emphasis on urban market (75% of its sales) than rural, and are looking to strengthen its portfolio mix with a clear focus on the core.

In an exclusive interview with TOI, Nestle India CMD Suresh Narayanan said three factors will define the texture of consumption going forward. One is the mix of the portfolio which companies enjoy between super-premium, premium and mainstream products. “We will be expanding, but will be judiciously combining premiumisation with more mass-oriented products,” said Narayanan.

The second factor is the demand for a variety of products that consumers seek at different occasions.

“That’s what we played to with the aggressive innovation/renovation programme that we’ve had on 61 products in the last three years. That’s about three times what we were innovating before. The pace of innovation is going to play an important part,” said Narayanan.

Third is consumer-centricity of a brand. Those companies, said Narayanan, which are more consumer-centric and anticipate products that consumers might need are ultimately going to win the game with their agility and responsiveness. “Today’s consumer, whether rural or urban, is seeking not just good price value but also trustworthy and sustainable quality. Consumers are looking at brands that are relevant to them. 

That’s a journey that companies need to traverse. So simply because your brand has been around for 50 years, in a particular format or price point, speaking a particular language, is not enough,” said Narayanan. Nestle India bucked the slowdown and declared a domestic revenue growth of 10.5%, which was better than its peers, in September quarter.

A number of companies are said to be going back to focusing on the core. L’Oreal India, which had ventured into low-unit-price packs a few years ago, has withdrawn the sachet strategy. “Sachets are not part of our strategy,” L’Oreal India MD Amit Jain told TOI recently, adding, “We are focused on the premium play.”

Narayanan said it is not going to be a quick slope up. Narayanan said, “Equally, if you have to kick-start consumption, then we have to either put more money directly in the hands of people or indirectly through a tax effect.”"
0,2018-12-01,Nestle,"Kripesh Adwani thinks “Good Morning” texts from Indians are not filling up the internet anymore. They have been replaced by “Good Morning” GIFs. The Bhopal-based app developer has created more than 60 apps for Android — some offer shayari, others photo-editing. 

Last year, his parents demanded an app with good morning GIFs customised for them — where they can relate to the cultural context of the images. The 24-year-old son obliged. He created two apps — Funny GIFs for WhatsApp & Facebook and All Wishes GIF 2018. In 12 months, both have more than 1,00,000 downloads on the Play Store.

GIF or Graphics Interchange Format, an animated 2-3 second video clip sans audio, has been around for decades. It was first created in 1987 by a team of developers at Ohio-based software company CompuServe, led by scientist Steve Wilhite. Born before the internet, faded due to patent wars and royalty rows, GIFs were revived with the rise of listicles (think Buzzfeed) and social news commentary platforms like Reddit around 2010. Soon enough, social media pros started using GIFs to express their thoughts and emotions, almost turning the format into a language.



According to Syed Hasan, founder of digital agency A&B Advertising, Indians have always loved GIFs. Its usage shot up towards the end of 2016, he says, when cheap handsets and cheaper data plans became accessible to a majority. Even a basic search for GIF on Google Trends for India shows an interest score of 28 in the first week of November 2016 going up to 58 towards the last week of December ’16. By the end of December ’17, this score had gone up to 100, signifying peak popularity. 

Last week, the term GIF was at a popularity level of 77 on Google Trends in India. GIFs are also now one of the four sub-categories in the search bar for anyone browsing Google Images on a smartphone. Meanwhile new- a ge brands like Netflix prefer using contextual GIFs over boilerplate responses while communicating with users on social media.

Over the last five years, every leading social media platform has introduced GIF search as an in-built feature to enhance user experience.

Instagram launched GIFs for its messaging service two months ago. “On every other platform, GIFs aid in communication. On Reddit, they are conversation starters,” says Hasan. “A common thread starter on Reddit would be a recent comment (Donald) Trump made on an issue. Earlier it would be in the form of a text. Now it’s a GIF. So, people know not only what he said, but how he said it, too.”

In March this year, Google acquired a prominent GIF company called Tenor that has almost as many users as Twitter at this point. Anyone who uses a Gboard (Google’s keyboard) on their Android phones, is likely to use Tenor’s GIFs in their conversations. A Google spokesperson told ET Magazine that Tenor has seen a five-fold growth in GIF consumption from India over the last year and a half.

Mumbai-based creative consultant Payal Khandelwal browses the internet for the right GIF to share in a chat instead of speaking her mind through other forms of communication like images, videos, or texts. Her penchant for GIFs has caught on in her circle and others have started communicating in GIFs as well.

In the GIF-crazy community, people feel that a sad panda hiding its face says “Sorry” better than words and emojis combined. A cat filing its nails looking completely disenchanted is a popular GIF that implies that you are waiting for someone to respond, or simply waiting. Pop culture GIFs are a rage. Some users particularly enjoy sharing GIFs of Mona Lisa rolling her eyes, winking, or sticking her tongue out. It’s the same in Adwani’s family group, except the GIFs are based on Indian themes. Mona Lisa is replaced by Hanuman tearing his chest to show that Lord Ram and Sita reside in his heart. It’s a favourite GIF for those wanting to show respect to elders in the group. A picture speaks a thousand words. A GIF speaks several thousands, notes Adwani.

GIFs communicate thoughts and emotions in a fun manner, but they are also serious business. New York-based Giphy claims users are watching a cumulative 4 million hours of GIFs through its platform every day, and it plans to monetise these numbers. One of the most obvious monetisation strategies is to get brands to sponsor GIFs. A brand can use GIFs for several purposes. A sneak peek into a new product launch, a quick how-to preview, or circulating clips from famous or most recent campaigns to create brand recall and retention are all strategies brands are experimenting with.

And unlike ads that are considered intrusive, people love GIFs. “GIFs provide four times the engagement level of a usual display banner,” says Sharadh Manian, GM at digital agency SVG Media.

Tenor is already signing deals with brands such as Nestle, KFC and Nissan by offering them placement for branded-content GIFs. How does this placement work? The back-end team at each of these GIF-making companies attaches several relevant keywords to every GIF, including the sponsored ones. When the user searches for, say, “hungry”, GIFs from brands such as KFC or Nestle pop up among other suggestions.

According to a Bloomberg Businessweek report, clients are paying Tenor anywhere between $100,000 and $500,000 for placement of sponsored GIFs in their engine.




Seeing the success of global players toying with the format, several GIF companies have come up in India over the last two years. Most of them, however, are currently focusing on user growth rather than revenue. Take Gifskey, for instance. A year-old startup led by Manan Maheshwari, Mahesh Gogineni and Varun MS, Gifskey is a platform that curates user-generated and proprietary GIFs across eight major Indic languages and supplies those to partners, including keyboard companies, content and news aggregators, dating apps, et al. In one year, it has seen GIF consumption grow from 1 million impressions a month to 120 million, the company claims.


 Xploree, a Hyderabad-based keyboard company, is one of Gifskey’s partners, and another important player in India’s emerging GIF universe. The company sources some of its GIFs from Gifskey’s library, in addition to partnering with the likes of Giphy for generic GIFs, to offer a wide variety to its 6.5 million monthly active keyboard users. In the last six months, the company has seen a 50% monthon-month growth in consumption of GIFs through its keyboards. Its CEO Nutan Chokkareddy is actively engaging with brands to monetise these numbers. “A lot of movie producers and even banking companies are keen to work with us,” he says.




Gurgaon-based Ankit Prasad and Mohd Wassem’s virtual keyboard company Bobble has managed some success in monetising GIFs. Bobble keyboards come embedded with Bobble’s signature GIFs, memes, emojis and stickers, and have 5 million monthly active users at present. Its GIF shares through the keyboard have gone up by 160% since last year, cofounder Prasad tells us. “We charge Rs 8-12 per share for sponsored GIFs. Past deals include films like Padmaavat and Padman, and brands like Reebok and Tata Ace,” he adds.




Third-party keyboards such as Xploree and Bobble are downloaded by users or come pre-installed on devices through partnerships with handset makers running Android. Xploree has such deals with companies like Karbonn Mobile, Intex Mobile and Huawei, while Bobble has partnered with Gionee and Lava, and a few others. The terms of such partnerships vary. “Some partners pay for licensing our software, others prefer a revenue share. Some handset makers also pay per impressions,” says Xploree’s Chokkareddy.

Tenor, too, has had a few partnerships with entertainment companies and studios in India, says David McIntosh, head of the GIF sharing platform at Google. “We recently worked with Viacom18 on their films Baazaar and Andhadhun and with partners like Dice Media and SNG Comedy. Tenor is now exploring ways to incorporate more coverage of regional content and Indic languages so as to capture all the richness and diversity of India’s popular culture,” he adds.

This need for hyperlocal GIFs puts the likes of Gifskey and Bobble at an advantage over global players like Tenor and Giphy. If a user from a tier-2 town in Tamil Nadu wants to show he is angry on chat, he is going to look for a Rajinikanth GIF and not a Johnny Depp one, says Gifskey’s Maheshwari. 


 “Most Indians are likely to use a Shashi Tharoor GIF to pull a grammar Nazi’s leg in a chat group than pick a nerdy character’s GIF from a Western drama to make their point,” adds SVG’s Manian.

In mature markets such as Japan and China, he says, GIFs form 30-40% of content exchanged through messaging platforms such as Line and WeChat. “In China, for instance, GIFs are all about getting popular icons to enact user’s personal emotions. The biggest trend there is to use North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s GIFs to add humour to any conversation,” he says.

Manian has had some success in convincing brands of the benefits of GIFs. “Brands in the alco-bev category that depend on surrogate advertising are more willing to try sponsored GIFs. But their campaigns are cyclical and, therefore, they roll out a GIF once in a while. Brands in the sports and fitness category show intent to try GIFs every quarter.” Adwani feels the craze for GIFs has come down now, with WhatsApp and others pushing stickers in the market. Sandeep Tandon, former founder of FreeCharge and an investor in Gifskey, disagrees.


 “Stickers are static and can’t match the beauty of GIFs when it comes to communicating,” he says, adding that he hasn’t seen a slowdown in numbers despite the sticker launch by WhatsApp. He reckons Adwani may be losing out because most other GIF-makers are tying up with keyboard companies to expand reach. When Tandon met Gifskey founders, it wasn’t because he was looking for a GIFs company, he says. “But I was convinced there’s something to be done in this space. We are betting on a human trend here. You don’t know where it’ll go. But in our business,” he says, “you figure it out as you move forward.”"
1,2018-12-03,Nestle,"Mumbai: Growing health consciousness among younger consumers is widening the market opportunity for niche protein-based brands, which were hitherto consumed by an ageing population.

Industry experts said the awareness around protein intake has resulted in 25- to 30-year-olds making such products a part of their daily diet. This has fueled a growth of brands that were earlier relegated to a small segment of society and were used by the masses only when recommended by a doctor.

One such brand is Protinex that is redefining its journey and the manner in which it communicates with consumers. Danone India director (marketing and health care nutrition solutions, or HCNS) Himanshu Bakshi said, “The understanding about health among young adults (20-30 years of age) has significantly changed in the last three years. In the past, Protinex consumption was largely driven by consumers over 35 years of age. Today, the brand attracts a younger group of consumers. We see a trend of youngsters becoming more aware about their health as the reason for this shift in Protinex becoming a ‘younger brand’.”




It is a well documented fact that most malt-based milk food drinks that are targeted at children were consumed by adults as well. The reasons were a lack of awareness about muscle health in the absence of clear communication by marketers. Today, the influence of social media and a growing tribe of nutritionists communicating about the right way of eating is driving sales of such products. GSK Consumer Healthcare India — the maker of Horlicks, for which global multinationals Unilever and Nestle are fighting a close battle — came up with a differentiated offering like Horlicks Protein+ to target working adults who are likely to miss out on adequate protein intake due to hectic lifestyles.

GSK Consumer Healthcare India area marketing lead (nutrition & digestive health) Vikram Bahl said, “The protein market in India has shown huge potential, and investments behind fast-growing segments of high science, such as Horlicks Protein+, has shown good uptakes since its launch.”

Although nutritional products continue to remain in demand among older consumers, they are also simultaneously gaining popularity among consumers under 35. At Amway, which owns Nutrilite, the contribution in sales from under-35 direct sellers/consumers in its nutrition and wellness category has increased from 35% to 40% in a year.

Amway India chief marketing officer Sundip Shah said, “This trend is largely driven by rising health consciousness, focus on fitness and the increasing awareness of the need and importance of maintaining optimum nutrition levels. Protein is our largest selling product and is popular with consumers of all ages. Young consumers are also taking to our protein for general health, fitness and its versatility due to its neutral taste.” Shah said Amway leads the protein category in India with a share of 25%, according to Euromonitor. The nutrition market in India is said to be of the order of Rs 5,000 crore, according to industry estimates.

However, nutritional drinks are priced almost double the regular milk food drinks. For instance, a 400 grams PET jar of Horlicks Protein+ costs Rs 495, while Horlicks Classic Malt is priced at Rs 228 for 500 grams. The trend of consumers veering towards nutritional products would certainly result in better value growth for marketers."
2,2018-12-03,Nestle,"Mumbai | New Delhi: Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), the Indian unit of Unilever Plc, will merge GlaxoSmithkline Consumer Healthcare with itself in an allstock deal that will give the country’s largest pure-play consumer goods company access to Horlicks, Boost and Maltova malted drinks brands as well as distribution rights for a five-year period over over-the-counter and oral care brands such as Sensodyne, Eno and Crocin.

The merger values GSK Consumer Healthcare at Rs 31,700 crore and its shareholders will get 4.39 shares of HUL for each of their share. After the merger, which is expected to be completed in a year, Unilever’s holding in HUL will fall from 67.2% to 61.9%. GSK Plc will become the second-largest shareholder in the merged entity with 5.7% stake. It can offload its stake to any investor and Unilever does not have exclusive rights to buy these shares.

Boost, Viva and Maltova brands will be owned by Hindustan Unilever.
However, the Horlicks brand, which is currently owned by GSK Plc, is being acquired by parent Unilever and HUL will pay royalty for its use in India.

“This is a very strategic and transformative move for us. Once the merger is complete, we see significant synergies in terms of top line and costs,” said Hindustan Unilever chairman Sanjiv Mehta on Monday. “From the lens of Indian consumers, health and wellness is a big need. This (the merger) squarely fits into that space and (it) makes immense sense to get into this category from a strategic point of view.”

HUL shares jumped 4.12% to close at Rs 1,825.90 on the BSE. GSK Consumer Healthcare shares rose 3.75% to close at Rs 7,542.85 apiece, translating into a market cap of Rs 31,721crore. 

The merger will significantly bolster HUL’s food and refreshments portfolio.



With GSK Consumer Healthcare’s annual sales of Rs 4,200 crore, HUL’s revenues for this business will exceed Rs 10,000 crore after the deal is completed, making it one of the largest food companies in the country. GSK’s brands will also see a three-fold jump in distribution since HUL reaches over 8.2 million retail outlets in the country.

“The potential deal is win-win for both the parties as the acquisition of strong brands in the health food drinks category would enhance the margin of HUL’s food business by 900 basis points to 27% from current 18% of sales with sustainable profitable growth. Deal is also positive for shareholders of GSK Consumer in view of better value under the share-swap deal,” said Kaustubh Pawaskar, research analyst at BNP Paribas.

In addition to the India leg of the transaction, GSK Plc is also selling its 82% stake in GlaxoSmithKline Bangladesh Limited and other related brand rights for GSK’s consumer healthcare nutrition activities in certain other territories to Unilever, for which it is expected to receive cash proceeds worth £566 million, or Rs 4,987 crore.

This could possibly be the last M&A activity under outgoing Unilever CEO Paul Polman. Many of Unilever’s recent acquisitions have focused on beauty and personal care products.

In March this year, GlaxoSmithKline Plc chief executive Emma Walmsley had announced a strategic review of Horlicks and other consumer healthcare nutrition products, adding that the company was exploring a partial or full sale of its stake in Indian subsidiary GSK Consumer Healthcare by the yearend.

This was triggered by GSK looking to help fund its $13-billion buyout of Novartis’ stake in their consumer healthcare joint venture.

Several leading consumer goods companies had evinced interest in the consumer healthcare nutrition business, but Unilever finally edged past Nestle in a competitive auction.

GlaxoSmithKline Plc chief strategy officer David Redfern said India remained an important market for his company.

“The company will continue to invest in growth opportunities for its over-the-counter and oral health brands, which include Crocin, Eno and Sensodyne,” he said. “The final amount of net proceeds received will only be determined once the shares in HUL to be received have been monetised and after hedging costs, taxes and other expenses have been settled.”

GSK’s global consumer nutrition business, which essentially comprises malt-based beverages, generated £550 million in 2017 and roughly 80% of the sales came from India. Horlicks is by far the market leader in the malt-based beverages segment in the country with 43% share followed by Mondelez International’s Bournvita, which has around 13% share.

Traditionally, this has been a strong segment and generations of Indians in urban areas have grown up drinking Horlicks. But growth has slowed down over the past few years in India as consumers increasingly shift to specialised products made by nutraceuticals companies such as Abbott and Danone.

This has prompted some to describe the deal as an ‘expensive acquisition’ for HUL. The deal size is over seven times the revenues of GSK Consumer Healthcare and about five times the value of the entire malted beverages category. A senior executive of a consumer goods company which had initially shown interest in Horlicks said the brand had good recall but it had the ‘senior citizen’ tag attached to it. “It does not resonate well with the young. Also, you can become a target for NGOs and activists because it is a sugary drink,” said this person.

In India, the packaged food and beverages market is heavily skewed toward biscuits, salty snacks and aerated drinks and is worth nearly Rs 75,000 crore in size. Healthier segments such as malted beverages, cornflakes and oats remain on the fringes.

HUL, however, is upbeat about the merger and growth prospects.

“In the medium term, we see that we will grow this business in double digits, and given the synergies on the cost side, there is potential to increase margins between 800 to 1000 basis points at 8% to 10%,” said Srinivas Phatak, chief financial officer at HUL.


Food for thought
Over the years, HUL has struggled in the packaged foods segment, especially in the low-margin business. The maker of Knorr soup and Lipton tea has been focusing on core packaged food and beverage brands with higher margins and exited tea plantations, oil, fats and biscuits businesses. It also moved out of the bread and bakery business under the Modern brand.

This year, HUL combined its food and refreshments business into a single division to increase agility. The merged business — including Knorr soup, Kissan jam, Bru coffee, Lipton tea and Magnum ice-cream — accounted for sales worth Rs 6,328 crore, or less than a fifth of HUL’s overall sales in FY18.

While HUL leads the market in segments such as soups, jams and tea, the size of these categories are significantly smaller than most mass segments in the foods space.

For Unilever, though, food is a core growing business and was the secondlargest category until last year. After Unilever merged it with the refreshments portfolio, the combined business accounts for 41% of sales and is headed by former Hindustan Unilever CEO Nitin Paranjpe."

Unilever’s departing Chief Executive Officer Paul Polman, in a major push into India that may be his last deal, agreed to pay about $1 billion more than his closest rival for GlaxoSmithKline Plc’s consumer business in the country, according to people familiar with the matter.

The Anglo-Dutch conglomerate agreed to pay 3.3 billion euros ($3.8 billion) in cash and stock from its Indian subsidiary to take control of the consumer business, including malted milk drink Horlicks. Nestle SA’s offer was lower, but was all cash, the people said, asking not to be identified because the details aren’t public. One of Polman’s last acts as CEO will be attending a capital markets day in India with the rest of his executive team this week.

Graeme Pitkethly, the Anglo-Dutch company’s chief financial officer, said comparisons were difficult because of the way the offers were structured.

“I hate to speculate, but I very much doubt” that Unilever outbid Nestle by $1 billion, he said Tuesday at the investor day in Mumbai. Representatives for Glaxo and Nestle declined to comment.

Monday’s deal may help ensure Polman’s final move as CEO isn’t dealing with fallout from a disastrous decision to move Unilever’s headquarters out of the U.K. in favor of a single base in the Netherlands -- a change he’d hoped would enable more deals. He was forced to abandon the plan in October after shareholders rebelled.

Under Polman, Unilever thwarted a takeover bid from U.S. rival Kraft Heinz Co. in 2017 and sold its spreads business to private equity firm KKR & Co. for $8.1 billion later in the year. The India deal is the company’s third-largest purchase since he took over in 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

Unilever’s high price may have been needed to convince Glaxo to accept an offer that wasn’t all cash. When Glaxo announced that it was reviewing the business in March, the firm said it wanted to use the proceeds to fund a buyout of its joint venture with Novartis AG, implying that offers needed to provide the British business with ready money."

Tata Motors: Auto major Tata Motors is planning a large-scale overhaul of its sales network across the country over the next one year as it prepares to bring in new products, including premium SUV Harrier. In another development, the homegrown auto major said S&P Global Ratings has downgraded the credit rating of the company and its British arm Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Plc. Tata Motors’ issue credit rating and senior unsecured notes rating have been revised to 'BB-/negative watch' from the existing 'BB' due to weaker profitability at JLR, the company said in a regulatory filing.

Sun Pharma: Even after assurances from Sun Pharma’s founder Dilip Shanghvi to alter certain business practices, large fund houses and brokerage firms remained unhappy with the prevailing corporate governance culture at India’s biggest drugmaker, according to a report by ET. The lack of disclosures around non-related party transactions to the tune of Rs 2,200 crore has become a sore spot for investors, who are questioning the nature — and beneficiaries — of these loans. The uncertainty has seen the Sun Pharma stock skid 11 per cent in just two trading days.


Bombay Dyeing: Bombay Dyeing and Manufacturing company has said that it is likely to start pre-payment of its debt from the current fiscal year as cash flows begin to kick in from the realty business, Vishu Peruvemba, chief financial officer said.

On Ryan, Forbes said he is part of the YouTube trend of unboxing, in which content creators film themselves opening up toys, tech products and other consumer goods, explaining different features and, in Ryan's case, ""screaming and giggling with enthusiastic delight as he does so.""

Nearly all of Ryan's money, or about USD21 million, comes from pre-roll advertising on his channels 'Ryan ToysReview' and 'Ryan's Family Review'. The remaining USD 1 million comes from sponsored posts.

""When views go up, so do these automated ad dollars. With more views than anyone else on the list, it's no surprise he claims the top spot,"" Forbes said.

Ryan has signed with kid's entertainment studio Pocket.watch last year and in October, it was announced that content from his channel will be repackaged and distributed on Hulu and Amazon.

In August, he launched 'Ryan's World', a toy and apparel collection sold exclusively at retailer Walmart. The line, which Ryan heavily promotes on his YouTube channel, features a variety of slimes and putties, Ryan action figures, T-shirts and toy cars.

""It's so cool"", Ryan, who serves as creative director, said of seeing his face in the aisles of Walmart.

Forbes said because he is a minor, 15 per cent of Ryan's earnings are funneled into a ""Coogan account"" which is protected until he becomes a legal adult. A good portion of the rest likely goes to paying managerial and production fees—as well for all of those toys.

""So what happens if Ryan, tomorrow, decides he no longer wants to broadcast his toy adventures for the world? Well, his managers and agents may not be too happy. But as for Ryan, 'he's got enough money for 100 lifetimes,” says Chas Lacaillade, the founder and CEO of Bottle Rocket Management, which represents many unboxers, in a Forbes report."

7,2018-12-13,Nestle,"BENGALURU: Bengaluru’s transformation from a garden city to India’s tech capital has not only changed its landscape, but has also caused concerns over the thinning green cover. A recent study by IISc professor TV Ramachandra says the city’s green cover has come down alarmingly from 68% in 1973 to 6% in 2017.

Interestingly, this has sparked a new housing trend — botanical spaces are coming up within four walls. Architects and developers are catering to the eco-conscious home buyers and bringing nature inside apartments and row houses in the Rs 1-3 crore category. Many home buyers are lapping it up.

Linston Manoj Gojer, 44, managing partner at an industrial solutions company, is moving from his independent bungalow of 10 years in Peenya to an upcoming rowhouse off new Bangalore International Airport Road. His Peenya bungalow, apparently, has no space for green cover. The new home comes with an in-built botanical courtyard, besides the living room and a miniature step-garden adjacent to the dining space. 

“Since most of our lives are spent between the four walls of our home, it is important for me and my kids to be as close to nature as possible. Access to greenery and sunlight in every room is a luxury,” says Gojer.

While the selection of trees is not finalised, the plan is to source them locally. “Since Bengaluru’s weather is conducive to cultivation, it is easier to implement such green projects in the city than in cities like Hyderabad,” says managing director Kamal Sagar.

The call for environmental conservation today comes from all sections of the society. While car manufacturers are investing extensively in R&D to create a new fleet of low-emission vehicles and adopt more sustainable business practices, every individual should do their bit to take care of the environment.

Sanjeev Aggarwal, Vice President - After Sales & Supply Chain at Nissan Motor India, shares smart tips to reduce the carbon footprint of your vehicle and keep the environment safe.NextDon't Miss Car's Health Check-Ups5 Jun, 2018Regular check-ups are vital for a car's top-notch performance. There is a direct link between your car's health and its emissions. A well-maintained car engine is more efficient and burns less gas, further reducing airborne emissions.

Ensure the tire pressure is always inflated to match the manufacturer-recommended Pounds Per Square Inch (PSI) rating. If not, they will need more energy to move and maintain speed, resulting in more gas usage per kilometer. This will further add to the increasing carbon dioxide and other emissions.NextTurn Off That Engine5 Jun, 2018While you're always 'raring to go' on the road, treat the red light as a break from the hectic urban life. The easiest, oldest and most efficient emission-cutting hack - switch off the engine at the red light - will work wonders. A running engine in a stopped car is still wasting fuel. Hundred cars stopping at the red light at a time can not only add to emissions, but also increase the particulate matter your fellow drivers are breathing in.NextPUC Checks Are A Must5 Jun, 2018Mandated by the Central Motor Vehicle Rule 1989, the Pollution Under Control (PUC) certifies that a car has passed testing for emissions compliance with national standards. A PUC certificate is a mandatory accompaniment to be carried by drivers at all times. As responsible citizens, we must have our cars tested for PUC certification every six months. By this biannual brief test, we can participate in reducing pollution in a small and significant way.NextUse Foam Car Wash5 Jun, 2018While 'soap and water' is the most popular method of cleaning cars, it can use as much as 160 litres for a single vehicle. Dirty water runoff seeps into drains, causing immense harm to water bodies. Instead, a more sustainable method like car foam wash can save millions of litres of water.

9,2018-12-17,Nestle,"MUMBAI: Switzerland-based startups are scouting for partners in India to collaborate on clean technology, driven by the huge market in the country and the government’s push for clean energy.

The Swiss government-promoted organisation, Swissnex India, has facilitated more than 350 startup collaborations through market validation so far.

The collaborations would also help reduce the cost of technology as the Indian market would give them scale, and in return, make the technology more affordable for their own market.

“Big Swiss companies like Nestle and Novartis have business interests in India, but with cleantech, it is different. We develop a lot of technology but the price levels are very high in our country and we cannot produce those products. Indian market is huge and price sensitive. If we manage technology transfer with Indian companies, the prices go down because of the huge market here, and then we can manage to take back the product to our own market as well,” Philippe Muller, head of cleantech initiatives, Swiss Federal Office of Energy, told ET. Muller was in the city with a team of startups and researchers working on clean technology offerings, primarily in the energy space.

The companies from the land of the Alps have developed solutions that can help Indian solar industry, offer solutions for off grid power supply to rural areas, and even support the country’s aspirations for electric vehicles.

Swiss startup hiLyte LLC has developed a non-toxic iron consumable based battery that can be used for lights and even mobile phone charging in households which are not connected to the grid or face outages.

“It is like an affordable espresso machine for clean and safe electricity. We did some customer testing in a village near Patna in Bihar which had just been connected to electricity grid but still faced 6-8 hours of power outages. We want to explore more opportunities in India, it can be an affordable solution for power backup,” said David Lambelet, cofounder of hiLyte.

Martin Ebner, CEO of Battrion AG, which has thus far been active in China and Korea, is looking to tap on India’s plans to manufacture electric with its technology for lithium ion batteries that can reduce charging time to half.

“Besides existing battery makers, there are automobile companies and components makers which are interested in this. We have concrete interest from some companies,” Ebner said."

12,2018-12-31,Nestle,"It’s been a big year for the companies that sell coffee, but not so much for the growers that supply them. That could start to change in 2019.

Historically low prices for coffee beans in 2018 will likely reduce the incentive for farmers to expand supplies, said Rodrigo Costa, the US-based coffee director for Brazilian trading company Comexim. That could mean a price spurt ahead, analysts say, as major moves within the industry promise to boost consumption worldwide. Coca-Cola, for instance, spent $5 billion in 2018 to get into the java space. 

Meanwhile, Nestle made its third-largest deal in 152 years when agreeing to pay $7.15 billion for the right to market products from Starbucks, which is now expanding in China at a rate of a new store every 15 hours as demand in the world’s second largest economy booms.

 “You can’t have everybody in the chain winning at the same time,” said Lucio Dias, commercial director at Cooxupe, the world’s largest coffee-growers cooperative. “Now, it’s been the time of the industry.” Next year, he said, the growers may get a bigger piece of the action."

1,2019-01-03,Nestle,"NEW DELHI: Shares of Nestle India fell from the day’s high after Supreme Court revived the class action suit filed by the Central Government against the company’s Maggi noodles, while setting aside NCDRC order.

After rising over 4 per cent to Rs 11,499 in the morning session, the stock pared gains and was trading at Rs 11,253, up by 1.92 per cent at 1:25 pm.

The company had moved the apex court against the tests ordered by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC).

The government had filed the suit in the NCDRC after the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) raised the safety concerns over Maggi noodles. The consumer court had ordered fresh tests on Maggi samples.

The Supreme Court said that the NCDRC will continue the probe based on 2016 CFTRI report from the Mysore lab. 

In 2016, the NCDRC had stayed the centre's class action suit against Maggi noodles."
2,2019-01-03,Nestle,"New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Thursday gave the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) the go-ahead to proceed with a class action suit brought against Maggi noodle makers Nestle three years ago by the Centre for allegedly selling noodles that fell short of the existing food standards.

Nestle will face the suit armed with a lab report which gives it a clean chit on this score. The Centre said it will contest this report in the commission where it claims it is representing scores of consumers.

The Centre had filed a class action suit against the company in 2015 in an unprecedented move seeking Rs 640 crore by way of compensation for allegedly selling noodles containing excessive lead and flavourenhancer MSG to consumers.

The company had then moved the top court seeking a stay on the proceedings until the samples seized from it were tested and analysed.

The Mysuru-based Central Food Technology Research Institute Laboratory (CFTRI) has since backed its claims that lead and MSG in its noodles, the market leader in this segment, were well within permissible limits.

Nestle lawyer Abhishek Manu Singhvi urged the Supreme Court on Thursday that it reject the government’s claims that there was excessive lead and MSG in Maggi noodles on the basis of the lab report, but a two-judge bench led by Justice D Y Chadrachud referred the matter back to the NCDRC for a hearing.

Singhvi argued that the government had filed the class action suit days after the Bombay High Court had quashed an order passed by food safety regulator FSSAI banning the sales of Maggi. The High Court had gone on separate lab tests ordered by it.

But the bench shrugged off his arguments in the face of resistance from the additional solicitor general Vikramjeet Banerjee. He contended that the central government should get an opportunity to object to the lab report in the NCDRC and that the court should not dismiss the case. Any such hearing in the NCDRC would come at the cost of adverse publicity that had hit sales hard last time the controversy surfaced. The company, though, sounded upbeat in its email correspondence with ET.


 “We welcome the orders passed by the… Supreme Court in the Maggi noodles matter today. Nestle India had challenged two interim orders of the NCDRC before the Supreme Court in 2015,” said a company spokesperson. “…Samples were sent to CFTRI and the analysis results showed that samples were compliant for lead and other relevant parameters. …the Supreme Court, in view of reports received from CFTRI, has agreed with Nestle's contention and has set aside both the interim orders passed by NCDRC….The Supreme Court has also directed the reports received from CFTRI be the basis for proceedings before NCDRC.”

“Reports show lead below detectable limits in some samples and only minuscule quantities of lead in others,” Nestle’s lawyer Rajesh Batra said in the court.

Reacting to the justices as to why they should eat noodles if there is any lead, Nestle’s lawyers said: “It was explained by us that the lead is present everywhere and therefore post proper scientific evaluation, a limit of 2.5 parts per million (PPM) is fixed as permissible limit. We do not add any lead to the product and minuscule quantities can come from purely external sources like air, water and grains.”

The lawyers said CFTRI results showed that in some of the samples the presence of lead has been found as traces and far below the permissible limit.

FSSAI CEO Pavan Agarwal declined to comment.

The top court will hear separately the other challenge pending in the court against a July 13, 2015, Bombay High Court order that had defanged the FSSAI. The regulator had moved the top court against the decision.


FSSAI Sets New Packaging Rules
New Delhi: India’s food regulator has prohibited the use of material made of recycled plastics including carry bags for packaging, storing, carrying or dispensing articles of food under the packaging regulations that will come into effect on July 1.


The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) also banned the use of newspaper and other such material for packing or wrapping of food articles. The new regulations include Indian standards for printing inks for use on food packages.


FSSAI has introduced the new rules after conducting two studies through the Indian Institute of Packaging and the National Test House. The studies showed that the packaging material used by the organised sector in India was largely safe. However, there were concerns about the use of material by the unorganised sector. They raised serious concerns about the safety of loose packaging material.

FSSAI chief executive Pawan Agarwal said there would be difficulties in the implementation of these regulations, particularly as they related to loose packaging material and the unorganised sector. However, these would raise the bar of food safety in India, he added. — Our Bureau"
4,2019-01-03,Nestle,"Packaged foods maker Nestle India said Thursday it has ‘welcomed’ the Supreme Court order, even as the apex court revived the class-action suit by the central government against the company in the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) in the Maggi noodles case. A bench headed by Justice D Y Chandrachud said the report from CFTRI (Central Food Technological Research Institute, Mysuru), where the testing of the Maggi noodle samples was conducted, will form the basis for the proceedings.

A spokesperson for Nestle India said in an email that it had challenged two interim orders of NCDRC before the Supreme Court in 2015. As per directions of Supreme Court, samples were sent to Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI) and the analysis results showed that samples were compliant for lead and other relevant parameters.”

The spokesperson further added: ""As per the lawyers who appeared for Nestle, the Supreme court in view of reports received from CFTRI, has agreed with Nestle's contention and has set aside both the interim orders passed by NCDRC which were challenged by Nestle. The Supreme Court has also directed that the reports received from CFTRI will be the basis for proceedings before NCDRC. Full details will be known only after receipt of the order by the Company."" 

Maggi, Nestle India’s flagship brand, was banned by national food regulator FSSAI in 2015 resulting in the company taking a hit of Rs 450 crore and destroying more than 30,000 tonnes of Maggi noodles.

Following the ban, the Union government had moved the top consumer forum alleging unfair trade practices, false labelling and misleading advertisements by Nestlé and sought compensation of Rs 640 crore under provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.

The brand was cleared by government authorities after five months of the ban. Maggi noodles has since bounced back as category leader with a current share of close to 60%.

In November last year, Nestle global chief executive Mark Schneider had said in an interview with Indian media: “Staying close to local governments and local consumers is super important and the Maggi noodles case from 2015 in India is another example.” He had added that there was a “wave of sentiment building against the product and at that time it was hurting us very strongly.”

The NCDRC is expected to continue the proceedings against the Indian arm of the Swiss foods maker, based on an earlier Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI)."

Board meetings"
8,2019-01-04,Nestle,"In the first half of the year, you could lose a certain amount of value and then there may be a more normalised 
  
  
  kind of trend in the second half, Aditya Narain, HoR, Edelweiss Securities, tells ET Now. Edited excerpts: 
Good year, bad year, what is your sense for 2019?
Well, it should be an up and down year. In parts, it will be a bad year…


That happens every year… Up first or down first?
I suspect, down first. I suspect it is going to be down first and up a little later in the second half. We actually think it is going to be a year of two halves. The first half is going to be a half when you need to be watchful and when we think you could lose a certain amount of value and then get into a more normalised kind of trend in the second half.


And why is that? Is it because this year the market does not have a clearer picture on the election outcome as it was in 2014?
That is one part of it but that is preceded by the fact that globally, things are looking quite soft and uncertain. That is the key part. The extent to which India has outperformed over the last quarter, is something investors need to keep in mind. Plus at the end of the day, you have actually had a liquidity event. There was a credit squeeze towards the latter half of last year and one does not really know what the ramifications of that are. 

In that context, a market that has outperformed so substantially, is valued a little on the higher side. You just got to be a little watchful given that you have the dividing line in terms of the elections.


But are you worrying that are we going to fall in line and align ourselves with the US equities, the kind of fall that they are seeing and continue to see?
Not necessarily, but that needs to be an influence. Typically, over the years, markets have got more correlated. If you have a very significant standout, unless there is a huge change on the underlying, that standout does not sustain. There is a reversal to mean at some level and I think India is set for that.


And the huge underlying is unlikely to take place at least in the first half?
In the next six months, it is really hard to make that call. Cycles in India also tended to get a little extended and so for people who keep expecting earnings to suddenly bounce back or for the investment cycle to kick through very aggressively, that is being a little optimistic. 


What is the worst case scenario in the next six months that you foresee?
Typically we would tend to believe that the market range over the next six months is basically going to be about 9800 to 10,500. We are basically overvalued relative to our range and we are at least 10% off the bottom of that range.


I have a report from HDFC Mutual Fund. They said elections come and go but they never change the market return at least in a meaningful manner. But market commentators seem obsessed with election. Why is that?
It is a very simple thing. We are all being asked to call the market in a shorter term context and that is why we are making those calls. If you ask us what our year-end target for 2019 is, it is 11,800. If you ask me what is it looking like until the elections, I gave a slightly different view and we have to nuance our call to that extent also. That is where part of the story is and we are making the argument that when you have this level of uncertainty, the election being one element of it, the market should trend towards its mean valuations. 

Beyond that, you got to see it in the context of longer-term cycles and how they are playing out. We think you could be at a little bit of a premium closer to the end of the year once the dust has settled on this. Actually the way we are looking at it, this is a point in time to be defensive in one’s portfolio but to be optimistic in approach, you will potentially get opportunities in this period of time whether it is the global, whether it is the elections, whether it happens on the liquidity squeeze where things could actually break a little bit and that is the point in time when you treat it as an opportunity.


Autos are not defensives, but at this kind of level, you would argue at 13-14 times two-wheeler stocks, 20-22 times four-wheeler stocks like Maruti and you will not lose a lot of money. Can auto be that bombed out space, where you could be a buyer now?
I would not rush into that space at this point in time, not so much, because the valuations are not much more reasonable but from the fact that the discretionary demand cycle is clearly under a certain amount of question. Now these cycles are not down for three months. They typically tend to take more time. On top of that, you have the underlying event of the liquidity crunch in the system and this is a purely discretionary spend with financing as the backbone. 

If you do not have a clear outlook on that front, I would be cautious about expecting a lot of financing coming into the market in a very aggressive manner. It is not going to happen. In that context, you got to be a little watchful. In terms of looking at opportunities in the market, a lot of the market is looking at stocks that have come off 20-30% and are saying this has become cheap. It is a point in time when you have to look at absolute valuations rather than valuations vis-à-vis where they were three to six months back.


You like IT and are saying it is the safest bet to invest in the first half of 2019. If you are worried about the US, would not you be concerned about IT earnings given that the rupee has turned around?
There are two elements; first, the rupee is not that dramatic a component of that call, it moves up a little. Even when the rupee was falling, it was on the basis of our call. The basis of our call is that the whole push towards digital is something that is going to be a three-four year spend that will happen effectively. 

It is a cycle that is actually going to be much longer and you are in the early stages of it. That the US has been slow in the recent past will put a little bit of question mark to it, but quite honestly, when things get tough in the US, the digital part is where the spend will continue to be there because it is a base for looking ahead. There is a base spend and there is a spend that comes on top, this has actually shifted gear to being a base spend.


You are saying real estate, autos, SMEs are likely to bear the brunt of the NBFC credit slowdown. Don’t you think the slowdown is somewhat easing? 
Again, there are two parts to it. The first is the supply of money into providers of credit. That has eased off quite clearly, which was the NBFC funding squeeze that you saw. That has eased off distinctly. 

The other part is these borrowers who then become lenders and what is going to be their approach in terms of putting money out. They themselves are going to be much more watchful rather than be in a hurry to put out money. This can easily mean two, three quarters before the money is available to them. They are also going to be slow in effectively putting it out and that is what you need to watch for.


Reliance is very close to demerging their telecom business and they could list their retail business. 2018 was a trend changing year for Reliance in terms of stock performance. They got the Jio model right, their retail was able to scale up significantly. There was talk about big data. Markets are saying this is the next Tencent. What do you think 2019 could be for Reliance?
There are two parts to it -- how the business continues to fare and the corporate action that go in and around it. From a business perspective, it should continue to be positive. The petrochemical cycle remains comfortable. As far as Jio is concerned, that is on a good wicket. If anything, some parts of it is tending to accelerate. That is likely to continue and that is what is going to be the basis or how the market will look at it. 

The kind of corporate action that you are talking about will tend to be a function of market conditions and I would not invest on a stock based on sum of this. I would actually stick with what the fundamentals are looking like and I we remain actually fairly comfortable.


But their debt has gone high. The debt levels are highest ever in the balance sheet; telecom is still not making money. Is that a concern because markets always value businesses based on cash flow and that is where there is a fly in the ointment now?
Our analyst does not see a big trip-up as far as this is concerned but I remember absolute debt is not a measure of anything because as balance sheets expand, absolute debt will expand. What it is as a percentage of the balance sheet is what actually counts and I do not think there is any real issue from a cash flow perspective. I would not really get too caught up with that.


You have a big overweight on pharma?
Overweight is not a sectoral call, it is more a stock picking call which effectively makes it overweight. As far as trends in the pharma space are concerned, they are still pretty mixed. You have some businesses which have transitioned which are in good shape and which should see an upswing. There are others which are more generic in nature. They still have the challenge of pricing pressure. So our call on pharma is actually more stock driven. Our stock bets are really Dr Reddy’s and Lupin.


What about a stock like Sun Pharma? 
You know at this point in time we really do not have it in our portfolio but it is a good company, it has a lot of strengths but there is always a timing element to it. The stocks that we are really calling are Dr Reddy’s and Lupin.


Why Lupin?
In many senses, their business cycle has effectively tended to turn the stock. If you notice, it has come off very substantially over the last couple of years. As I said, a lot of it when it comes to pharma stock calling it is very specific in terms of the cycle they are in terms of their product pipeline. And there we are actually pretty comfortable in terms of what is going to roll out.


When it comes to pure play, FMCG, Dabur and Nestle are your top picks. Clearly, the Maggi issue is not a factor for you?
We have got to be watchful about building portfolios on some of these events that come and effectively go. As long as the business cycle where they are operating is good, we are effectively very comfortable and that is the story both for these two stocks that we are talking about. What we would like to emphasise is that one of the themes that we like in this whole space is really the rural theme, not necessarily because there is a lot of pricing as far as agri products are concerned.

The political shift that is taking place at this point in time towards the rural irrespective of which government comes into play is likely to result in a fair amount of money going to that space over an extended period of time. That is really our call in that space. But specifically in terms of the Maggi issue, our calls are based in terms of the business cycle and unless there is something very specific, we are watchful at a stock level.


A couple of year ago, you said markets will always get surprises from two pockets -- metals and corporate banks. The view in the market is that corporate banks will surprise us and metals will disappoint us. Would you agree?
Our portfolio strategy would suggest as much because we have got an overweight on the banks and in particular the large banks and we have got an underweight as far as the metal space is concerned.


Is that in the price already?
If you were to normalise and look through for another year rather than talk about weeks and a few months I do not think it is in the price at this point in time. 


Markets always tend to focus on what is in the price and what is not in the price. Where do you think the news would be strong but the stock market reaction may not be large because either it is in the price or valuations are stretched? Similarly, where could the news be bad and the stocks may not fall because those stocks are cheap, like Tata Motors? 
The challenge exists with the market rather than at the stock level. It is a bigger issue with the market. The market is sitting at a slightly elevated level relative to what has happened to the rest of the world. In the last quarter, you have outperformed the bulk of the world by 10% to 20% on a currency basis.


Only the Nifty. Our fund managers friends have not even beaten the index last year.
Yes, but when you call markets, there is a large element of it and it is really hard to believe that the top end of the market struggles and the lower end or the mid end of the market has a lot of appetite to bounce back.


But is 2019 also that year when you need to take that tactical call because in 2018 you were busy playing it safe? Is it time to increase exposure to small and midcaps or do you balance it out with largecaps?
I would actually shift the way one looks at it. Instead of talking about largecaps and midcaps, I would think of it in terms of market leaders and secondary players in respective businesses. You can be a smallcap and you can be a market leader in your space. Business consolidation is likely to happen over the next couple of years and is going to put a distinct premium on market leaders. Whether you are largecap or a smallcap, market leadership is something where people will increasingly pay a premium for for the reason that those businesses are going to grow in a premium manner.


In terms of market leadership, in several sectors like IT and consumer, the leaders do well as also in pharma. But in investment-led themes, even a stock like L&T has not scaled up as much as one was anticipating. Same is the case in some of the engineering business which have been badgered and power sector. So, it is not across-the-board that leaders have performed, it also depends on the sector that you are representing.
Absolutely. The underlying business cycle of that sector is very critical, but what I am talking about is within that sector who does better? If the sector grows at 15%, the leaders are likely to grow at 20%. It is my call that within sectors, there is going to be a leadership bias in terms of getting a larger share of new business and logically a larger share of the economics also. That is what the market will eventually value up. But coming back to your point, in terms of playing it tactically, the next six months is both the time to be defensive in portfolio but opportunistic in terms of outlook. That is a tactical approach saying that if stocks do come off, rather than getting too excited by relative valuations over the last three months, you have to be aggressive.


But will you stick with the leaders?
At the end of the day, stocks and businesses reflect their ability to generate a greater level of growth and profitability. You have reached a little bit of a shift in the economy where leadership is going to dominate rather than what has happened in earlier growth patterns, particularly if you go back a decade when the smallest guy actually managed to disproportionately get a larger share.


Would you buy a stock like HDFC Limited? Serious market share consolidation will happen in NBFC space after this liquidity crunch.
We have upgraded the stock when this whole liquidity crisis broke out and our argument was very much this and this is an argument that got extreme over the last three-four months. But is something is actually going to extend beyond and the stock has performed likewise.


What do you think could be a differentiated proposition for 2019? 
There are two ways of looking at it. Our positioning is very distinct in that we are saying be very watchful at this point in time. We are not saying that this is going to be a trend line that I put a year-end number and I extrapolate it. I say this market is likely to fall and so to that extent, you need to hedge against it. If it falls enough, you need to be aggressive and we would be ready to switch our portfolio if that effectively materialises. 

Beyond that, we are making the call that it is going to be a normalised market environment first but you should step back. That is the bulk of our argument. We think that economic cycles in India have got extended. For the last two years, everyone has been calling earnings will recover and the investment cycle will come up and that has been a disappointment. 

The reason that has happened is that there has been three-four-year historical cycles in India. This one has got stretched to six-seven year cycle. You are looking at the bottom of a cycle that is actually shallower but when it starts coming through and plus/minus six months is the timeframe that you are effectively looking at, it is actually going to be a pretty extended cycle. So instead of playing this whole tactical thing over this period of time,you are getting to a stage where… and elections are a good defining point in it from a timing perspective. 

Over the longer ,term you are going to get a much more solid cycle which may not be as sharp. If anyone is expecting a 30% earnings recovery in 2020 because it is bottom, they are running ahead. What you will see is 15% to 18% for five to seven years and that is going to be the nature of that recovery. 

You really have to wait and watch how the markets value it. They could value it upfront or it could be a more extended valuation. But what is changing actually is that you are reaching the bottom of cycles and that can be earnings, the investment cycle, the asset quality cycle, the risk cycle or the regulatory cycle. You are getting into the bottom and what is going to really happen is that beyond this period, it is hard to time plus/minus six months. But you are close to near the bottom and you are going to get an extended cycle. It will disappoint only if people exaggerate the response. It is going to be a more structural kind of cycle rather than a very heavily cyclically inclined one."
9,2019-01-04,Nestle,"Consumer centric stocks are moving at high valuations, but in an election year, these are difficult to avoid, says Dhirendra Tiwari, head of research (HoR), Antique Broking. He is of the view that momentum should continue in 2019 as far as Indian equities are concerned. He spoke to ETNow. 


Edited excerpts:
Is that a happy feeling that we have managed to outperform the rest of the world stepping into 2019 or is it a scary feeling that we may just fall in line?

Exactly, it is a very happy feeling because not many times we see Indian markets outperforming for the whole of the year. It's good and not scary at all. 

Overall momentum remains pretty positive and therefore, there are events during this year which can be material on the market’s performance. Yet, we are pretty constructive and momentum should continue in the rest of 2019 also as far as Indian equities are concerned.



What is your big theme for 2019? What is it that you are advising clients to be on this year?

If you look at 2018, the big theme was consumption and exports. We had FMCG, staples doing pretty well. IT sector also performed very well. One can argue that the valuations sort of moved even ahead of earnings expectations. 

We have been contemplating for the last few quarters that probably the revival investment cycle will be the theme that is going to play out in 2019-20. The overall view is that while consumption remains a decent theme for the industry whether it is a good investment opportunity, one has to be cautious as valuations are trading significantly higher than the mean and averages. Recovery in investment cycle can lead to significant earnings growth in sectors dependent on the cyclical recovery and that becomes a very interesting area to look at for 2019.



Where do you find opportunities within consumption?

In consumption, retail for example remains a decent area of growth and valuation. If you look at staples, that has probably been trading at pretty high valuations. That is an area which is a market performer for us. In consumption, one would be a little more focussed on retail than staples. 

On the discretionary side, we are sort of cautious to negative on automobiles whereas we are positive on consumer discretionaries like air conditioners and consumer electricals and the like. There are certain opportunities in the consumer discretionary space, particularly retail, consumer electrical and electronics.



Where you would spot opportunities within investment-led themes? Do you think that the government’s increase in spending on infrastructure and engineering space would lead to a greater bias in buying stocks there?
I will just give you some background here. Look at the capex part of the country, which is GFCF, gross fixed capital formation. This has three components. One is private investment, the second is government and PSU investment and third is households. We have seen the government and PSU investment is shaping up pretty well for the last couple of years whereas private investment, which is almost 40 per cent of gross fixed capital formation, has been muted. 

What we are witnessing today is increase in utilisations. There has been a reasonable amount of growth in certain key sectors like cement, steel or you can talk about certain other areas of growth like ferrous, non-ferrous and automobiles and so on and so forth. 

As the RBI has pointed out, the system utilisation levels have also gone to almost 75 per cent, which in our opinion is a threshold capacity utilisation level. We are witnessing early signs of private capex recovery and this is sort of supported by all the companies that we meet. 

If that has to turn around, I would assume that there are a lot of opportunities in the investment recovery theme place. Corporate bank becomes a big large play within that space. We like capital goods and infrastructure stocks also within that category. These two areas along with select cement companies becomes quite interesting space to look at. 


Within cement, would you stick to sector leaders or would it be a more regional bet you are taking?

Cement has little confusing state of affairs in the sense that the overall environment remains quite conducive from the demand point of view. We have seen almost a double digit growth for the past few quarters and demand will continue to be strong because of the base effect. It can go to 7-8 per cent. 

Having said that, this has also attracted a lot of capacity expansion which in our opinion is likely to keep prices in check. In cement, it's very important to see the valuation comfort. We would pretty much go with the top company, which is UltraTech, and also look at some of the companies cheaper in valuations like ACC and Ambuja Cement. 



I was also just scanning some of your other bets and I see that there is a lot of focus on financing companies especially gold businesses. Muthoot Finance is part of your list. Are you going in for bargain hunting within financials outside the very obvious high quality names like Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv in some of the beaten down names over the the last three months?

NBFC remains a concern area. The only area which has done pretty well both in terms of earnings and stock performance has been gold financing companies. That has been one of our preferred bets for quite some time. 

Muthoot Finance is one. It has been a big outperformer. We continue to have faith in that. As for rest of the non-banking finance companies, we think there may be opportunities in CV financing companies. That also remains an interesting bet. A few companies exposed to CV financing are the ones which we should look at. For the rest of it, we will have to wait for a while before we start looking at valuations and where the opportunity lies. 



Apart from the names and sectors you have talked about, have there been any large additions to your model portfolio or any changes thereof?

If you go to our previous reports and strategy, we had very significant overweight on consumer sectors, which are basically staples and automobiles. W have cut down meaningfully on these two. Consumer is now a market performer or you can say market weight and auto are slightly negative. These are key changes. 

The change has been on the positive side on industrials and infrastructure and also consumer discretionary. These are three areas where there has been an upward change. In the financial space, we continue to have a positive bias on private sector banks essentially.



What would be a big avoid for you from a valuation standpoint?

From the valuation point of view, there are two which have been the outperformers last year -- consumer and IT. If you look at all leading stocks in the consumer space whether it is Lever or Nestle or Britannia or the like, they are all trading at meaningfully higher valuation than their historical averages. That is point number one.

Second, the growth has been quite robust in the last 4-5 quarters. There can be some moderation in growth, going forward. Valuations are capturing the sustained growth that we have seen, which are largely driven by not only volume growth but also cost side benefits. If there is a moderation in growth even by 2-3 per cent, there will be some challenge to high valuations these companies are trading at. 

It is very risky to say a complete sell on this sector because this is an election year and therefore investors would like to remain protected within consumer names to some extent. To make money from these levels is quite challenging and therefore we recommend no fresh additions, hold on to these stocks. 

In the automobile space, there are weaknesses emerging on the volume and cost front. That is again an area where we think one should look cautious starting from the leader in the category."
10,2019-01-04,Nestle,"The Indian arm of Swiss food company Nestle SA is set to release advertisement campaigns highlighting the “trustworthy facts” about its instant noodles brand Maggi. This comes a day after the Supreme Court revived the class-action suit by the government against the company in the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC). 

“Our approach as a credible, trustworthy and responsible company is to always communicate with consumers on facts, in a simple, clear and transparent tone and manner,” a spokesperson for Nestle India said in an email reply to ET’s query on the upcoming campaign. “What you will see in the print ads, to be released over the next few days, is just that.” The campaign starts on January 5. 

When the national food regulator, Food Safety Standards and Safety Authority of India (FSSAI) had banned Maggi noodles in 2015 for containing lead in excess of permissible limits and mislabelling of flavour enhancer monosodium glutamate, the move had resulted in the instant noodles category being almost wiped out of the country, and the company taking a hit of Rs 450 crore and destroying over 30,000 tonnes of the product. 




Nestle had subsequently released high-decibel, dedicated campaigns across print, television, YouTube and social media platforms including Facebook and Twitter, on the ‘safety of Maggi noodles’, but the response was seen as a bit delayed. By then, the brand’s credibility had already been questioned and it had been pulled off shelves. 

Following the ban, the government had moved the top consumer forum alleging unfair trade practices, false labelling and misleading advertisements by Nestle, and sought compensation of Rs 640 crore under provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. The brand was cleared by government authorities five months after the ban, and it then bounced back as category leader. 

Its current market share is close to 60%. At the court hearing on January 3, bench head Justice DY Chandrachud said, “Why should Maggi noodles have lead at all? I would be averse to eat Maggi with lead in it. Why should children eat Maggi with lead?” The bench said the report from Central Food Technological Research Institute in Mysuru, where the Maggi noodles samples were tested, will form the basis for the proceedings. At the court hearing, Nestle India’s lawyers said the lead in Maggi noodles was “below detectable limits”. 

“Reports show lead below detectable limits in some samples and only minuscule quantities of lead in others,” Nestle’s lawyer Rajesh Batra said in the court. “It was explained by us that the lead is present everywhere and, therefore, post proper scientific evaluation, a limit of 2.5 parts per million (PPM) is fixed as permissible limit. We do not add any lead to the product and minuscule quantities can come from purely external sources like air, water and grains.”"

In the ad, Nestle said that ""lead occurs naturally in the Earth's crust (present in the air, soil, water, grains and other materials)"".

Nestle said that to ensure food is safe, Food Regulations specify safe-limits for several elements including lead. ""Maggi noodles has consistently cleared these tests,"" Nestle claimed in the ad.

The ad campaign came after the Supreme Court instructed the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commision (NCDRC) to revive a three-years-old class-action suit against Maggi noodle makers, filed by the Centre, for allegedly selling noodles which fell short of the existing food standards.

The Centre had filed a class action suit against the company in 2015 in an unprecedented move seeking Rs 640 crore by way of compensation for allegedly selling noodles containing excessive lead and flavour enhancer MSG to consumers."
13,2019-01-08,Nestle,"Mumbai: Locally listed units of large multinational consumer companies could see a 5-12 per cent increase in fiscal 2020 estimates of earnings per share if their minority shareholders reject proposals to pay more than 2 per cent of revenue as royalty to overseas parents.

Companies like Hindustan Unilever Ltd, Nestle India, Colgate Palmolive India and GSK Consumer Healthcare must obtain the approval of a majority of minority shareholders before April to pay royalties beyond the 2 per cent mark for the ongoing fiscal year.

Colgate, Nestle and GSK Consumer pay an over 2 per cent royalty and need to secure approvals from minority shareholders. HUL pays a little less than 2 per cent, plus 1 per cent as ‘fees for central service’ from parent Unilever Plc.

“In a scenario of rejection by minority (shareholders), if the aggregate pay-out to the parent goes down to 2 per cent, there could be meaningful earnings upgrades for our coverage,” CLSA said in a note to clients. “We estimate an upgrade of 5-12 per cent for the four companies, with the highest upside for Colgate and Nestle.”



According to JM Financials’ estimates, HUL could save as much as Rs 555 crore, or 6.4 per cent of EBITDA, in the fiscal year through March 2019 if the minority shareholders reject an over 2 per cent royalty.

HUL is expected to pay 3.4 per cent of EBITDA as royalty in FY2019. GSK Consumer, Colgate and Nestle are expected to save Rs 65 crore, Rs 153 crore and Rs 311 crore, respectively.

In fiscal 2018, Colgate Palmolive paid Rs207 crore, or 4.78 per cent of net sales, to its US-based parent as royalty. GSK Consumer paid Rs 128 crore, or nearly 3 per cent of its turnover of Rs 4,377 crore, to GlaxoSmithKline.

Theoretically, capping royalty at 2 per cent would mean savings of 6 per cent of EBITDA for HUL and GSK-Consumer, and 12 per cent for Colgate and Nestle, said Vicky Punjabi, vice president of equity at JM Financials. “But we believe minority shareholders may not want to argue against status quo and will approve the practice” of paying over 2 per cent royalty, he added.

In 2017, a committee led by Uday Kotak suggested an approval from a majority of minority shareholders in case royalty to an MNC parent is in excess of 5 per cent of revenues. The committee believed there was value in brand and technology, but stated that shareholders must be allowed to vote on the terms and conditions of such pay-outs."

Every cloud, they say, has a silver lining. Clouds gathering over a company can also rain profits at times, if one is smart enough. Great investors like Warren Buffett have made a career out of these opportunities, while the majority ran for cover at every whiff of a problem. Investment opportunities come in many forms and the world’s smartest have made the most of such situations.

It is this one trait that distinguishes investment ‘greats’ from the average Joe. One just needs to look at Warren Buffett, billionaire investor and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, and his most successful investments to gather why the ‘crisis investing’ matters.

In 2011, Buffett bought $5 billion worth of preferred stock at Bank of America, which would come with a 6 per cent dividend. He also negotiated the right to buy 700 million shares of the bank’s common stock any time before September 2021 for $7.14 a share, the Motley Fool writes. At that time the warrants were worthless, and the stock traded below the quoted price. This was the time when the world’s financial markets were barely limping back to normalcy in the aftermath of the global financial crisis of 2008.

Investment banks were still a bad word at that time and Lehman Brothers had gone belly up. Bank of America’s share price has tripled since then, and Buffett has made more than $14 billion from this investment.

Buffett’s mentor would call this the ‘cigar butt’ strategy, which essentially means buying an asset or a security at a throwaway price. Many a time, markets tend to beat down prices of securities well below their intrinsic values. It is for this reason that investors must learn to capitalise on crisis.

Satyam is a great example of this ‘cigar butt’ theory. One needs to look back at Satyam’s stock price, which fell to Rs 542 from Rs 650 in January 2009 after its chairman Ramalinga Raju admitted to an accounting fraud of over Rs 7,000 crore. In April 2009, the company was acquired by Tech Mahindra after a bidding process. The stock touched Rs 66.15 by the end of 2010, an absolute return of (-) 63.6 per cent in 24 months. Despite the accounting fraud done by the promoters, Satyam had a credible business and its US customers were paying the company dollars for providing them IT services.

Despite the fraud, there were plenty of companies which wanted to acquire the business. Tech Mahindra was one of them and wanted to diversify its service offering, which till then was focused primarily on telecom.

If an investor had invested Rs 10,000 in January 2009 in the stock of Satyam, it would be worth Rs 1,91,543, (an absolute return of 91.5%) today.

Companies can run into trouble from time to time. These situations can drag a company’s stock price down to rock bottom levels, because markets tend to overshoot in times good and bad. There are several key factors that can lead to such special situations where the company’s stock is beaten down to unrealistic levels.

Among many disruptions, regulatory change can prove to be a big one. A sudden change in the regulatory environment can cause the broader market to react negatively.

But once such uncertainty subsides, companies tend to return to normal.

A good example of this is the real estate sector, which is adapting to Real Estate (Regulation & Development) Act (RERA). It is a change, but one that it is for the better and this will be good for large organised big players over the long-term, but till the sector readjusts to this new reality, stock prices may remain depressed.

Special situations bring another recent example to mind. Shares of Infosys went into a tailspin and fell 13 per cent on August 19, 2017 when CEO Vishal Sikka quit. Nothing drastic that had happened, and Infosys remained a bellwether. But management changes often lead to near-term worries, and the market presses panic button because everyone likes continuity and predictability.

The stock came under pressure as investors thought the company’s future growth was at risk. But with one of the founders, Nandan Nilekani, returning to the company, it’s business as usual. Investors with a long-term orientation, who can stay focused, tend to benefit from such wild gyrations.

Infosys, for instance, generated 70 per cent returns between August 2017 and September 2018. Mr Market can be very irrational and unpredictable, but if investors can keep their emotions aside and look at such situations rationally, then they can benefit immensely from these temporary blips in the market, which can allow one to buy great stocks at throwaway prices.

Consolidation in an industry and unfavourable business cycles can also lead to a company’s stock being beaten down temporarily. In the lifespan of a company, there will come a time when it would face a difficult business environment. 

These can be structural or due to changes or weakness in the environment. For instance, Maruti share price fell in 2012 after the strike at its Manesar factory, but in next three years the stock price increased 286 per cent. Similarly, shares of Nestle were beaten down to Rs 5,000 from Rs 7,000 in June 2015 on news that there was excessive lead content in Maggi noodles. From June 2015 to August 2018, Nestle’s shares have risen 108 per cent.

At times, a new entrant can wreak havoc in the market and affect the profitability of existing players. Hyper-competition has severely crimped the profitability of existing telecom players in India. Reliance Jio launched its 4G services at rock bottom prices and that has affected financials and margins of the incumbent players like Bharti Airtel, Vodafone and Idea. As a sector matures and growth moderates, consolidation

follows, which is what is happening in telecom. Given the size and scale of investments required in 4G, Vodafone and Idea saw benefits of scale and choose to merge.

With the number of operators shrinking to three, the spoils of the market will also be shared by only these companies. With a population of a billion, Indians will increase consumption of data and over time prices will stabilise too.

When Black Swan events happen, like demonetisation for instance, few have the foresight to look beyond the immediate news. While this event impacted consumer goods companies, as cash was sucked out of the system, it had a beneficial impact on insurance companies, mutual funds and banks.

Going forward too, some situations will create temporary discomfort for markets and investors. But these events will also provide opportunities to those who are comfortable in going against the herd mentality. Be it the fallout of China’s trade war with the US or the data revolution reshaping many Indian industries, opportunities will arise from such a rout.

If the trade war escalates and duties are imposed on Chinese goods, then developed markets like the US will look for alternative markets to source goods. And India could well be a beneficiary of that disruption, as developed countries cannot create capacities overnight. Rather than run for cover, look for special opportunities when a crisis comes calling.

18,2019-01-29,Nestle,"Market researcher Nielsen will soon begin tracking online e-commerce sales data in its research in response to rapidly growing online sales as FMCG companies have raised concerns about data not being fully representative.

Nielsen South Asia executive director for retail measurement services, Sameer Shukla, confirmed that the data and analytics company would begin mapping online sales measurement soon. “Nielsen continuously endeavours to enhance its retail measurement offerings by capturing all forms of consumer points of purchase, online as well as offline. E-commerce measurement is definitely one such important milestone in it.”

E-commerce contributes about 2% to India’s Rs 3.4 lakh crore FMCG business, up from 0.4% in 2016, and its share is expected to widen to 11% by 2030 — an 8-times growth from its current size, a recent Nielsen report said.

“E-commerce is a fast growing channel for us and data representation from the channel is required for more accurate growth and market share mapping,” said biscuits maker Parle Products’ category head Mayank Shah.

The Nielsen report said urban markets, fuelled by a rapidly growing internet economy, accounted for a bulk of sales within e-commerce. The report said the e-commerce channel has grown at over 101% over 2017 and in specific product categories and markets, the contribution is already touching double digits of total category value sales.

“While online sales are small as of now for a category like ours, growth in the channel is projected to grow rapidly. Going forward, ecommerce data will be necessary and help us directionally,” said the managing director of confectionery category leader Perfetti Van Melle, Rajesh Ramakrishnan.

Perfetti Van Melle, which makes brands like Happydent gum and Alpenliebe candy, leads the Rs 12,000-crore confectionery category with more than 20% share.

Mid last year, consumer goods giant HUL had questioned Nielsen findings saying it was not giving a correct indicator in terms of growth and market share. The maker of Sunsilk shampoo and Magnum icecream had pointed out “base issues” with Nielsen numbers.

Online retail is growing four times faster than brick-and-mortar stores though on a smaller base, a report by consulting firm Bain & Company said. Riding on factors such as these, consumer goods companies are increasingly using the e-commerce channel to first test and soft launch products. ITC, PepsiCo, Marico and Nestle are among the large companies which have been launching products online only before placing them in traditional retail stores."

Top MNC stocks, such as Pfizer, Astrazeneca Pharma, Nestle India, Yuken India, Abbott India, Oracle Financial and Sanofi India, have gained between 5 per cent and 15 per cent in the past month when most other stocks declined sharply.

Sensex, on the other hand, gained just 2 per cent during this period while BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices fell 5 per cent and 6 per cent, respectively.

It’s logical to peddle multinational stocks when domestic stocks are rife with corporate-governance issues and volatility, say analysts.



“Investors find comfort in MNCs when there are crises in domestic stocks. They are not only governed well but also are answerable to foreigner regulators,” said Ajay Bodke, CEO (PMS), Prabhudas Lilladher. “Additionally, the MNCs are getting premium on their clean balance sheet, good dividend payout ratio, less or no debt and high level of transparency”.

Retail investors have also increased their stake in Federal-Mogul Goetze, Nestle, CRISIL, Orable Financial, Disa among others in the December quarter.

“Bad corporate governance doesn’t just hit the headlines, it impacts the bottom-line of the companies even more,” said Abhay Laijawala, MD, Avendus Capital Public Markets Alternate Strategies LLP.

“While MNCs do tend to perceived as well governed, there are Indian companies which are ranked equally well on governance.”

Several domestic companies are prone to political risks ahead of elections. Some of the political decisions will prove to have adverse effects on corporate profits. As most of the multinational companies are consumer centric, political risk is lesser, said analysts.

“MNCs are minimize exposure to political risk and elections are around the corner, its prudence to look for MNCs as a defensive bets” said Paras Bothra, head of research, Ashika Stock Broking. “Also, most of the MNCs are best bets in terms of dividend yield”.

The market was expecting a change in policy stance, but the rate cut came as a surprise. The market swung between gains and losses after the RBI move that economists say can give a boost to the domestic economy. 

However, after an initial knee-jerk response, the market turned stock-specific and remained so for the rest of the session. Sensex closed 4 points down at 36,971, while Nifty settled with a nominal gain of 7 points at 11,069.

Gains in shares of Sun Pharma, ITC, Maruti Suzuki and Bajaj Auto were offset by losses in Reliance Industries, HDFC and Larsen & Toubro in the 30-pack Sensex.

Global cues, too, were lacklustre. However, rupee's rise against the US dollar and a fall in crude oil prices offered some relief for the market.

2,2019-02-08,Nestle,"Mumbai: Nestle India stock hit a record high of Rs 11,777 on Thursday in anticipation of strong earnings growth for the year ended December 2018 riding on the back of market share gains. The third largest consumer staples company by market capitalisation will announce its December quarter results on February 14.

Nestle is winning back market share in its core categories on the back of increasing focus on distribution, product launches and strong media campaigns and is the most preferred stock in the sector, analysts said.

Nestle stock gained 65 per cent in the last one year to close at Rs 11,670.05 on Thursday, up 0.62 per cent. BSE FMCG index rose just 11 per cent in the same period. The stock is trading at 47 times FY20 estimated earnings, in line with Hindustan Unilever and at a 10 per cent premium to the sector. However, analysts expect this premium valuation to sustain on strong earnings and return on equity ratio.

“Nestle has superior return ratios and deserves a premium for its diversified product portfolio and access to brands and technology from the parent firm,” said Amit Sinha, analyst, Macquarie Securities India. “We are impressed by volume growth turnaround and expect strong growth to continue”.

Nestle remains the most preferred pick in consumer goods with 28 of the 38 analysts tracking the stock have a ‘buy’ rating."
4,2019-02-14,Nestle,"NEW DELHI: The world’s second-largest snack food company is eyeing a stake in a business that started as a humble shop in Bikaner in 1937. Trying to diversify its portfolio beyond breakfast products, Kellogg wants to buy a stake in Haldiram's which it has valued at $3 billion (excluding a Kolkata branch). The iconic bhujia maker, which now sells a range of desi snacks, has grown from a small shop into a vast empire while surviving disputes and break-ups in the original family business.


The humble origins
Haldiram's, which has become an iconic brand all over India and among the NRIs, started small with a shop in Bikaner in 1937. Ganga Bhishen Agarwal, fondly called Haldiram by her mother, got t67992895o know the recipe from his aunt who used to make a thick and soft prototype of the current snack known as Bikaneri bhujia. When Ganga Bhishen joined his family snack stall at Bhujia Bazar in Bikaner, he used the his aunt's trick. Pavitra Kumar mentions in her book 'Bhujia Barons' that Agarwal reinvented bhujia by adding moth (a type of lentil) flour to the snack which used to be made of besan (chikpea flour). He also made it thinner using a finer mesh. He knew how to brand his new product smartly. He named it 'Dungar sev' after Dungar Singh, the popular Maharaja of Bikaner. With his new brand, he parted ways with his grandfather's business. His product hit a chord with the buyers. After nearly a decade, he was selling as much as 200 kilo of bhujia every week and the price had gone up from 2 paise a kilo to 25 paise, writes Kumar in her book. Haldiram was a tall, agile and fit man even in his seventies, writes Kumar. He inspired fear and awe in his sons and grandsons due to his sobre disposition and serious mannerism. Even when he was 72, he moved in town riding his bicycle.


The beginning of the empire
The Haldiram's empire too had a humble beginning. Haldiram went to Kolkata to attend a wedding which gave him the idea of opening a shop there. That was the first branching out of the Bikaner bhujia business. The second generation did not expand the business further. However, grandsons Manoharlal and Shiv Kishan took the business to Nagpur and Delhi. The Chandni Chowk shop in Delhi proved to be a huge hit with the masses. Then came manufacturing plants in Delhi as well as Nagpur, followed by restaurants in major cities in India as well as foreign countries. The company came to be divided between three distinct areas of operations with Delhi-based Haldiram Snacks and Ethnic Foods in the northern region, Nagpur-based Haldiram Foods International in western and southern regions and a much smaller Kolkata-based Haldiram Bhujiawala in the eastern region. The Delhi business has emerged to be the largest. 


Dispute over trademark 
Breakups and disputes have marked the business empire as Ganga Bhisan's descendants have fought over territorial and trademark rights, a typical challenge for heritage family-run businesses. There is an ongoing dispute over the brand ownership and trademark. The estranged Kolkata faction, which operates primarily in West Bengal, has dragged the other two sides to court. The decade-long legal battle is currently in the Supreme Court. The group’s complex corporate structure with several subsidiaries and group entities and the ongoing disputes will pose a big challenge for a buyer.


Making billions from bhujia
The ongoing talks with Kellogg's involve two of the three branches of the company — Delhi-based Haldiram Ethnic Foods and its affiliates, and Nagpur based Haldiram’s Food International and affiliates. The two businesses are believed to be valued at around $3 billion (Rs 20,000 crore), excluding the restaurants business. The two divisions together, are expected to end FY19 with sales of Rs 4,500-5,000 crore and profit of Rs 450-550 crore.

When Haldiram’s revenues crossed Rs 4,000 crore in FY16, it had gained twice the size of Hindustan Unilever's packaged food division or Nestle Maggi and grew larger than the India turnover of the two American fast food rivals Domino’s and McDonald’s put together. In year ended September 2017, Haldiram's regained the top spot as the country’s largest snack company after more than two decades, surpassing PepsiCo in sales. Haldiram's posted sales of Rs 4,224.8 crore in the year ended September, compared with PepsiCo’s Rs 3,990.7 crore from brands such as Lay’s, Kurkure and Uncle Chipps. 


From Bikaner shop to French bakery
In 1937 when Ganga Bhisan set up his bhujia shop in Bikaner, he would have rarely imagined that Haldiram's would be selling Veg Shami Kebab, Soya Shami Kebab, Dahi Kebab and Hara Bhara Kebab. Haldiram's has definitely come a long way from Ganga Bhisan's thin, moth-dal bhujia to a range of kebabs it offers in the Middle East as part of its frozen foods business. In between, it diversified its namkeen snacks range by including sweets such as canned rasgullas and soan papdi, pani puri and now desi wraps. Recently, Haldiram’s signed its first partnership outside the family and entered into an exclusive master franchisee partnership with French bakery cafe Brioche Dorée, the world’s second-largest bakery chain. For the first time, the Brioche Dorée cafes will serve only vegetarian food 


What pulled Kellogg's to Haldiram's
The story of Haldiram's shows that foreign food businesses, however big they are, have to go desi to succeed in the Indian market. When the first McDonald's restaurant in India opened at Basant Lok in Delhi in 1996, it made a unique cultural concession — it became the first McDonald's in the world to not serve beef or pork products. Years later, it made another concession by introducing McAloo Tikki burger. Later, the Big Mac had to reincarnate as Mac Maharaja. No foreign pizza chain can hope to make its mark in India without offering vegetarian products. In 2013, in a first, American restaurant franchise Subway opened a Jain counter at its first all-veg outlet in Ahmedabad. Haldiram's is an attractive option for foreign buyers because it is difficult for a foreign food giant to build a desi food brand from scratch when desi brands can trace their heritage back to 1937!

A telling coincidence is the possessive in both the brand names, Kellogg's and Haldiram's. Like Ganga Bhisan of Bikaner, Will Keith Kellogg of Michigan in the US too invented a food item — corn flakes — more than a century ago. Kellogg's eponymous company rode on the popularity of corn flakes to become a global behemoth. Eying a stake in Haldiram's, Kellogg's may be thinking it would make a really hot mixture if corn flakes meet bhujia."
5,2019-02-15,Nestle,"I still say that in middle of April, we should be closer to 11600 and this time, midcaps will join in, Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive VP-Markets & Corporate Affairs, IIFL Securities, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:

What is happening in YES Bank and any other aspect which you want to highlight when it comes to market view?
Even though I have been saying the market will go to 11200, it has been a sour spot. The broader market is seeing such despondency which I have not seen in many years. A few errant promoters have definitely upset the applecart but that may be the end of the storm. I am extremely positive on midcaps with their valuations at throwaway prices. On the broader market, our underperformance is reflecting this despondency at a time when global cues have been extremely good.

 Same was the case with YES Bank. Where do you see 30%, 50% moves in F&O stocks? Bears have had a good time but despondency is a very good time to build portfolios and I can thump the table and say that next six months onwards, you will be making a lot of money in select stocks. 

I am extremely positive on the market with a slightly longer term view. This pessimism is overdone. I still reiterate that in middle of April, you should be closer to 11600 and this time, midcaps will join in. 

The temporary imbroglio of midcaps underperformance is a sour spot which is hurting sentiments and some of the flows. 


Those who are looking to buy an electric vehicle, will find it easy because the government is going to offer rebates of up to Rs 50,000 and may even bring it under the purview of priority sector lending. What is your view on EVs being the big disruptor?
After a four-year-long upsurge, the NBFC sector had headed for a slowdown. The auto sector faced tough times as funding from NBFCs dried along with third-party insurance getting costlier, it hit demand. For the next four, five years, a lot of these companies are putting in a lot of work in the EV side. Ashok Leyland is a clear example. From Rs 160, the stock has corrected to Rs 80. The numbers were extremely positive, a double digit EBITDA growth where most were talking of 8-9%; we know that defence spending is going to go up and Ashok Leyland stands out in a crowd. It is a very good play on the LCV, HCV market. It is the third largest bus maker in the world and it has now a huge impetus of 50% market share launching the EV buses in Gujarat and so on. There is a lot of pessimism in autos. We are slightly contrarian on autos and metals. We think that you can make a lot of money if you are going to be patient investor over here because the price is in your favour. 

Similarly, Eicher Motor, which has been hit by competition, offers an opportunity to buy at below Rs 20,000 level. 

The third would be definitely a Hero MotoCorp where their margin expansion in the coming quarters could again herald more consumption spending. 

So, as a contrarian, we are extremely positive on autos and we think these declines should be buying opportunity. On electric vehicles, if you want to play it, it is better go for the lithium ion play where Exide and Amara Raja will give exciting opportunities in the near future.


What is your reading on Emami or any other midcap FMCG plays?
People are trying to find loopholes in every small business. Emami is a very strong brand, built over years and they have a huge market share. I would not comment on the stock because that is a private equity investment but private equity is going to definitely take advantage of collateral risks in a lot of sectors and stocks. 

Coming to FMCG, we still think ITC should rule over there even though the stock has not done much. We think their business forays into all the other businesses except cigarettes are gaining traction on a day-to-day, month-to-month, year-to-year and the vision going forward is extremely bullish. 

You can add a Marico over there and we will re-weigh the works of Nestle where the margins got hit. It has been one of our outperforming stocks. 

Dabur would be another dark horse which has again moved up quite sharply from those 370 levels, but any decline would be a buying opportunity, Dabur has seen the worst behind, could be a huge outperformer in the near term. 


Do you like the quarterly performance that Glenmark delivered?
Yes that and Divi's Lab have been two of our midcap picks in pharma. This spinoff should add more value because that will demarket the marketing, with the generic side playing out well. Overall, if you wanted to play pharma, select outperformance should be seen in Aurobindo, Sun and Dr Reddy’s. Dr Reddy’s has done extremely well. The inspection visit may have been a little dampener but we will they will tide over these problems. Pharma can be a relative outperformer for 18% to 20% upside during the course of this year. But yes Glenmark would definitely be a buy on declines.


Would you be a buyer in YES Bank now that the two big overhangs have been lifted?
Yes good point. As a disclosure, we own YES Bank and we have been slightly contrarian around those Rs 175 levels. This time, they will get past Rs 230. They will not flatter to deceive. It has been three times they have hit here and come back. This time you could see an upside, maybe Rs 275. Given that, April may turn out to be a very good month for the markets, we think YES Bank may definitely lead Bank Nifty rather than being one of the losers. So yes, a large part of that may have played out yesterday. We are not going to chase it 30% up but all corrections will be buying opportunity. If you do sustain over Rs 230, the next target could be close to Rs 275 in the next few months.


What should shareholders do now? With SBI coming on board, would you wait it out to buy Jet, is it a buy right now or is it a complete avoid?
It is an avoid from my side. If I can suggest one stock which can make up all the loses of Jet, it would be IDFC Bank First. That bank is going to be the star of the next two years. I do not rule out a doubling from here. I am very confident on Mr Vaidyanathan. I think this merger will eat into market share of a lot of NBFCs and they should see a lot of bang for the buck. It is a best combination of MSME and retail loans which going forward will see an improvement in CASA. The valuations are extremely attractive. For me, it will be IDFC Bank First rather than anything to do with Jet which is again going to be an imbroglio on enlarged equity and rising crude prices."
6,2019-02-16,Nestle,"New Delhi: Three and a half years ago, brothers-in-law Karthikeyan Palanisamy and Harish Manoj Kumar decided to experiment with a unique business proposition — growing cacao and selling chocolate. Neither of them had any experience in the food business but Kumar quit his job as an engineer and returned to his Coimbatore hometown to become a fulltime farmer. His initial plan was to grow cacao and export the beans. He wasn’t discouraged by the fact that India wasn’t among the world’s largest producers, which are Ivory Coast, Ghana, Mexico, Ecuador, Brazil, Cameroon and Nigeria.

It was after the first crop that Palanisamy’s palate came into play. He started to tinker with the cacao extract to see if he could come up with unique flavours. Kumar and Palanisamy took samples to Chennai-based L Nitin Chordia, India’s first certified chocolate taster, and asked him to give them a try.

“If he wasn't going to like them, both the idea and the chocolate were going to be binned,” said Palanisamy. But Chordia liked what they’d done and that led to birth of bean-to-bar brand Soklet (that’s how farmers in Pollachi pronounce the word). The company has since established itself as farm-to-bar name with monthly sales of about 7,000 bars, each costing Rs 200-220.

Mason & Co, Pascati, Earth Loaf, Malabar Secrets and Kocoatrait, apart from Soklet, are among Indian chocolatiers making a name for themselves by experimenting with cacao, giving it a local twist. They are dark, bitter, sometimes gooey, with a hint of cardamom, nutmeg. Some may have an aftertaste of Bhut Jolokia (also known as Raja Mirchi ). Leveraging modern retail, ecommerce and more sophisticated taste buds, they rely on local spices and flavours to create a unique taste. They’ve discovered that Indian cacao beans are good enough to compete with South American or African counterparts.

Chordia estimates at least 30 bean-to-bar chocolate makers will hit the scene by 2020.He too has begun making his own chocolates under the Kocoatrait brand. (Cacao is pure chocolate; it’s processed into cocoa with the application of heat.) Globally, cacao has been on a rollercoaster from an all-time peak of $3,826 per tonne in March 2011 to a low of $1,815 a tonne in December the same year. Last year, cocoa futures returned 28% on the back of global supply shortages. Indian farmers have as a result ramped up production and many are seeking to make value additions themselves. The current farm and bean-tobar market, while nascent, is estimated to be Rs 6-8 crore and is expected to grow at 200-250% annually over the next two-three years. It should then grow at about 50% annually thereafter, said Chordia.

Designer Bina Ramani has entered with spice-infused Malabar Secrets chocolates that are a hit with members of the Cadbury family among others, she said. She uses cacao from her Chikmaglur farm.

For Ramani, packaging is key and accounts for upwards of 45% of expenditure. “My early career at Taj Hotels taught me that I shouldn’t compromise on packaging.”



Tamil Nadu is home to what’s probably the country’s biggest beanto-bar company, Mason & Co, which makes as many as 12,000 bars a month. It was set up by Jane Mason and Fabien Bontems in Auroville five years ago after they explored cacao plantations in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka. The brand is available in more than 100 stores in 12 cities with most sales in Mumbai, Delhi and Bengaluru.

Chocolatier Devansh Asher, partner at Pascati Foods, said Indian palates are still largely habituated to the sweetness of traditional chocolate confectionery.

“It's definitely challenging when chocolate is associated with sweetness. But there are a few quality chocolate makers out there doing anywhere close to ?8-10 crore of chocolate sales already,” he said. The company’s annual chocolate sales have jumped to Rs 80 lakh from Rs 8 lakh three years ago. Most of this comes from corporate gifting and the hospitality industry that keeps them going during the leaner, summer months.

Euromonitor estimates that India's confectionery chocolate segment grew 12.8% in 2013-18. This is dominated by the likes of Mondele z, which sells Cadbury chocolates, Nestle and Amul. Meanwhile, new entrants like ITC’s Fabelle and the Munjal family’s Choko La, which has been around for about 15 years, are aiming for the more upscale market. Imported brands like Royce also have stores but focus on chocolates across all categories.

NATURAL CAUSES
David Bello, a Britisher based in Mysuru, has been making beanto-bar chocolates with a team of seven under his Earth Loaf label for over three years. After last year’s Kerala floods wiped out cacao supplies, he’s been looking for alternative sources in Nicaragua, Vietnam and Sri Lanka.

Synthite, a Rs 1,600 crore natural food ingredients firm in Kochi, has just launched a farm-to-bar chocolate this month under the brand name Paul and Mike—Farmers and Fermenters with flavours such as custard apple, Alphonso mango, Jamun, Amazonian Pink Pepper, Balkan Rose and more in 70g and 14g bars.

“We use fine flavour cacao beans, real fruits and pure cocoa butter in our chocolates. At Rs 3.5 per gram, our price is almost the same as that of imported bulk brands such as Lindt and Ritter Sport but the quality is in the league of international fine chocolate brands such as Valrhona (of France) and Pacari, a farm-to-bar brand from Ecuador retailing at Rs 9 per gram in India due to high import duties. We are committed to make this brand grow to Rs 250-300 crore in the next few years,” said Vikas Temani, project lead, Paul and Mike.

Some farmers add natural vanilla to neutralise bitterness, unlike other parts of the world. “It’s still a small segment and as a concept, it hasn’t evolved yet. Maybe it’s because Indian cocoa tastes different from the rest of the world,” said Aaditya Singhal, managing director, Mandara Orchard, one of the biggest importers of artisanal chocolates in India.

Chordia, who sells about Rs 1 lakh of chocolate each month, is encouraged by the response. “Our sales are driven by a rather unique set of consumers who care about sustainability and the use of local products. We rely primarily on the online channels across metro cities,” he said."
8,2019-02-18,Nestle,"NEW DELHI: The Indian arm of Swiss food company Nestle SA said on Monday it is evaluating launching twothree dozen products in 2019 across categories. The company had crossed the Rs 11,000-crore sales mark last year. 

Addressing reporters at a roundtable meeting at its R&D centre in Manesar, MD Suresh Narayanan said, “Our core brands have performed well and we are looking to accelerate our business.” 

The maker of Maggi noodles and KitKat chocolate, along with Google, is set to roll out Ásk Nestle, an online portal which will give personalised information, curb fake news, and offer information on nutrition and dietary plans, the company said.

Narayanan said the company may consider using the portal as a platform for selling its brands online, which it may link with its own ecommerce website.

He said the company would continue evaluating inorganic growth.

Narayanan said the Supreme Court’s revival of the government’s case against the company regarding Maggi noodles in the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission last month has not impacted sales of the product. The company already has a CFTRI report that has cleared Maggi as being compliant for lead and other relevant parameters."
7,2019-02-18,Nestle,"After his grand success in Dubai, Bhupender Nath, founder and MD, Passion F&B, Dubai, is putting Indian fine dining on the centre stage in India. 

Born with a restaurateur’s soul, hospitality and starting his own restaurant has always been the goal for Bhupender Nath, founder and managing director of Passion F&B, Dubai. But for Nath, his flagship restaurant Trèsind was more than just another Indian restaurant. It was a mission to show the world that Indian cuisine was more than just butter chicken and 
biryani.


Back to his roots
When Nath was younger, his father had a small restaurant in Patna, which he lost after being cheated by his partner. Vowing to earn enough to gift his father another restaurant (he estimated it would cost Rs 25 to Rs 30 lakh), a young Nath moved to Nigeria at the age of 21 to start making money. Once there, he found his way to the fishing industry where he started a fisheries business called African Fish.

But the dream of opening his own restaurant was always on the horizon. In 2009, when he shifted his family to Dubai, that dream began to take shape. He was amazed by how often people would go out to eat but a little sad that they would overlook Indian cuisine while hosting guests. “Nobody thought of going to an Indian restaurant to impress their guests. It was always Japanese or Italian. That’s what I wanted to change [with Trèsind],” Nath said. With that aim in mind, Trèsind’s menu was crafted to reflect elements from all over the world.

But it’s not just the approach to Indian fine-dining that sets Trèsind apart. According to Nath, dining at the restaurant is an experience for the soul. “When you go out to eat with your wife or girlfriend, you’re basically treating your soul. It’s an experience in itself and we look into every segment of that experience from the food you eat to the interiors to plating.”


Bringing it home
Today, Passion F&B comprises five brands — Trèsind (Dubai, Kuwait & Mumbai); Carnival (Dubai); Gala (the outdoor catering division), Trèsind Studio (world’s smallest modern Indian restaurant) and the soon-to-be-launched global tapas bar A Cappella (Dubai)

Asked about launching in BKC, Mumbai, Nath said, “India was always the goal, but the challenge was bringing Indian fine dining to India. My team kept saying we should open in Mumbai, it’s the financial capital and people will appreciate if you do something different. I thought since we have been such a success in Dubai, why can’t we try here? I’m proud of that decision [to open in Mumbai] and people have been very welcoming.”

Although Nath has also received offers to open branches in other global cities like San Francisco and London, he is firm that one shouldn’t expand for the sake of expansion but should take the time to put the right team in place first. When asked about more expansion plans on the Indian front, he replied, “That’s a little premature. It’s only been one-and-a-half months since we launched in Mumbai and I want to really enjoy the success [of this chapter] first.”"
9,2019-02-19,Nestle,"ET Intelligence Group: Analysts are feeling jittery over the growth prospects of Nestle India. After gaining 13 per cent in the three months to February 7, its stock has lost nearly 12 per cent in the past seven trading sessions. In addition, the December quarter performance reflects pressure on the margin due to rising raw material costs and higher marketing and advertising expenses. While the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) giant may report a sustained topline growth in the coming quarters due to introduction of new products, analysts expect lower profitability.

The stock trades at a peak valuation – 60 times trailing earnings and 55 times forward earnings. With a weak December quarter performance, it is unlikely that the stock would be able to sustain such a valuation. Besides, most mutual funds are caught on the wrong side with their holding in the counter at a multi-year high of 3.1 per cent. Most of this addition was done during the December quarter. The stock’s valuation data for the last five years shows that it has not been able to sustain the valuation above 55 times earnings.



For the company, which has December ending financial year, 2018 was one of the finest years in terms of profitability with nearly 25 per cent EBIDTA margin, the highest in the last 10 years. However, its disappointing performance in the last quarter of the year (the December 2018 quarter) raises doubts on the consensus growth estimates and whether the FMCG major can sustain such a high profit margin. In the December quarter, EBIDTA margin dropped to 20.7 per cent -- a year-on-year drop of 380 basis points. The earnings dropped by 2 per cent compared with an estimated growth of 15 per cent.

A higher marketing costs on new products was the major reason of margin contraction. Nestle entered into a few new categories in 2018.

A steady rise in raw materials dented the profitability. In the near term, marketing expenses may normalise but it is unlikely that the margin will recover anytime soon."

11,2019-02-19,Nestle,"A huge amount of derivative market activity is taking place against the equity market delivery base volume, Deven Choksey, 
  
  
  MD, KR Choksey Investment Managers, tells ET Now. Edited excerpts:


What is that you are making of the developments in Zee?
Certainly the deal is moving in a positive direction. One, they are talking and engaging their creditors constantly and are keeping them in confidence. As a result, creditors are not panicking and market prices are not getting affected that badly. Second, they have been sure that they want to sell the stake and probably invite a strategic investor into the company who could possibly take the company to the next level in the internet space as OTT, video are the new platforms which are emerging very strongly. The company has the content and a distribution platform on the broadcasting side and need a player to help them grow the internet side of the activity. The content will get distributed on both the channels, the internet channel as well as the broadcasting channels which would fetch not only higher amount of revenue but also better number of subscribers. 

The company is moving very smartly with this model and justifiably so. The investors would probably buy into them. In the fall, one got an opportunity to buy into a quality business like Zee which has got all the promises for delivering smarter growth.


How was the overall situation handled for Emami? What is the way forward?
I am not tracking the company per se or the promoter group per se in as much detail but from outside, many of these promoters have probably chewed up much more than they could digest and as a result, there is a situation today where they are required to pare their debt and allow the businesses to go on a normal track. 

It is still a corrective measure and for that matter any promoter, who has not been focussing on the business properly and creating debt in personal capacity as well, would be most vulnerable to destroying the wealth and that is where the corrective measures are being taken. I am glad that this promoter group has joined this particular party and probably correcting the mistakes that they may have done. 

In a way it is a good thing. Corporate India is realising very fast that they need to stay focused on financial discipline on their investment and grow the core business in which they have invested money systematically, instead of spreading thinly across all the businesses. In a way, it is a good measure and there is nothing in specific that I can add into the Emami case at this point of time. 


L&T is the first port of call when you are betting on the industrial recovery yet L&T has started underperforming the index by a big stretch, why is that?
Two reasons, you are absolutely right that on one side if the industrial segment is recovering and if the infrastructure spending is happening, L&T is the first one which would have got benefited and they have actually started filling up the order book very systematically. 

The quarterly results numbers are also equally good. However, the verticals under which they are operating currently that is what something which the analysts do not like probably. They have already started the process of building the vertical base approach and probably they should at some point of time clarify as to how they are going to monetise some of these verticals because when an investor invests in a company, one wants to see a specific approach. Too many verticals operating and probably opaque structure getting created therein do not give confidence to investors. 

Somewhere down the line, the L&T management will have to provide clarity vis-a-vis the verticals that they are operating within the company and explain the monetisation process. Should that happen, the underperformance could be done away and the stock price should reflect direction thereafter. 

At this point of time, this is the reality. When you see the composite company, you find the valuation is also on the higher side. If you start seeing individual verticals and the potential therein, you can justify the growth in those verticals. These are the reasons for which the stock is underperforming currently. 


How have you assessed the overall corporate earnings and more importantly what are you expecting in the coming quarter?
The consumption space has ended up showing relatively better performance. Except for select autos, other consumption areas where you are seeing growth due to the spending by the consumer has grown very well. Even the sector which is connected with consumer growth including housing finance, credit finance or personal credits, have actually shown reasonably high amount of growth. 

The telecom space has disappointed with huge losses. Tata Motors has been a huge disappointment as they had to provide a significant amount of impairment charges into their books. These are some of the cases with exceptional performance, which has been on the negative side. 

But look at Britannia, they have shown good growth prospects and Nestle is another company which has started showing higher consumption-related growth. 

The overall earnings season has remained good. Financials have definitely performed well. Insurances have been confirming that they want to grow at 20-25% rate of growth. Web feel confident that going forward, select autos, select finance companies, insurance companies and some of the industrial contributors in the engineering and equipment side will continue to do well. The likes of ABB, Siemens should continue to do well in our view point. 


Describe your portfolio approach. How much cash are you sitting on? What are your top three holdings and what is this one name which you are ready to buy? 
We are sitting on around 15% to 20% of cash currently. I do not know why but there is a little discomfort in the market. My primary contention is that, a huge amount of derivative market activity is taking place as against the equity market delivery base volume. On a Rs 16,000-crore delivery base volume, on any given day you have 4 lakh crores worth of derivative market volume. I am not at all comfortable. I feel that structurally, the markets are going wrong and that has to get corrected.

That is the reason for which we have to sit on cash, so that we get an opportunity to buy equity at a lower price. We continue to hold good quality stocks in our portfolio and in recent times we have been buying some of the stocks. I may add names like Bajaj Auto and Ashok Leyland. In case of say Bajaj Auto, with an Rs 81,000-crore market cap, the balance sheet has a cash of around Rs 15,000-crore plus. 

Almost 20% of the market cap of the company, is cash in the balance sheet. The stock is neglected and underperforming for a long period of time. This is a good time to add the stock into the portfolio. At around 2500-2600 levels, we ended up picking some. 

These are some of the cases where huge amount of values are available and that is why you have to sit on cash because the market gives you such opportunities at lower levels for some of the good quality businesses that you would want to buy. 

The situation is similar with Ashok Leyland. Even in a quarter where everybody else is struggling, this debt-free company, has shown moderately good growth. I believe that commercial vehicle segment is likely to grow from here. The stock has corrected from around Rs 150 at one point of time to around Rs 80 -- almost half -- and these are the opportunities you should take advantage of in an irrational market. This is my justification for having some cash in the portfolio today to buy some of the good quality areas which are available at a neglected valuations currently."
12,2019-02-19,Nestle,"The only good thing is that there are not a lot of new issues except for the Bharat 22 ETF that took some money out of the 
  
  
  market, Pashupati Advani, pashupatiadvani@globalforay, tells ET Now. Edited excerpts: 

How long are we going to move around in a range? Up until elections will be quite a stretch, right?
Unless we get some direction that something is happening. So, maybe after the voting and some polls. Then there will be some excitement. But a lot of people are sitting on the side because of the fear of not conclusive government, one way or the other. That is what the challenge is right now.


What are you expecting?
I think the present government will continue but maybe not get a majority and that will actually put brakes on things. It will be nice to have one government or the other but having a hybrid is a bit of a challenge. But that is Indian politics. It has been hybrid for so long that we have forgotten. This is the only government that has been conclusive for a long time. Let us see what happens.


What are you going to do? Have you already built a portfolio or are you waiting for some certainty with regards to elections because that way, you will get a deeper correction?
You have to sit on the sides. Our market works on supply and demand and right now, FIIs are sitting on the side waiting for something to happen because anyway we are at highs, not exactly a cheap market. The domestic FIIs, SIPs seem to be going down. They are still positive but they are actually lowering, going down and the insurance companies are investing in this government divestment and things like that so that is also sucking a lot of money out of the system. So net-net, money is coming out of the equity markets. 

The only good thing is that there are not a lot of new issues except for the Bharat 22 ETF that took some money out of the market. We are in this holding pattern which is not good for brokers or for people in the industry. It is very frustrating and in this kind of an environment, a lot of people will walk away from the market and that is not healthy. 


But where is the opportunity? The currency move is benefiting certain sectors.
The rupee will probably get weaker in relation to the dollar. There is that flight to quality in the sense that the US is pulling money back but their economy is also not in that great a shape. As the rupee gets weaker, it is obviously good for IT and pharma companies. Pharma seems to have got hammered recently. So, there are opportunities in that space. I should be in IT but I am not and so that is another challenge that I face. But that is a personal bias.


Are you behind the ICICI, Axis and Yes Banks of the world or not quite?
I do not think the issues are over yet. Yes there is a flight to quality and so HDFC, IndusInd and Kotak are trading at huge multiples. The three that you just spoke about are looking like value buy but again Axis was at an all-time high and suddenly the government decided to unload some, so who knows? I personally do not believe the problems are over at ICICI by any remote chance. I would wait because there could be some more explosions to come because corporate India is not yet sorted out.


So you have completely stayed out of ICICI Bank?
Well I was out and in but I am not particularly bullish about that sector and I think the NBFCs are hurting even more because they are not able to get funding at a cheap rate. The so-called risk-free rates should be a lot higher than it is. FDs are at about 7-7.5% and they should be even higher. But since the government is the major borrower, they have pressured the banks not to raise the FDs but we are having inflationary challenges also and things are not working with those kind of interest rates.


There are lots of companies that are perhaps biting off more than they can chew. We saw the Essel Group with respect to their investments in infrastructure which the management acknowledged is a very big pain point for the company. Emami is now selling off its shares and they have got money in businesses like cement and solar etc which have not worked out. How are you looking at this sort of a trend?
Yes, both the names that you spoke about have actually come out of the blue because they were perceived as very strong groups and that is not so great and when Essel is talking about selling some of the jewels, that is a challenge. But let us see what pans out. Emami has sold 10% but they have got a huge debt and they have also got a huge foreign business as well. 

Again, the capex expansion has not worked and there are a lot of companies that have gone in for capex and we will have to see which ones work and which ones do not. Companies in speciality chemicals are doing well. So, they will turn because the demand seems to have gone up. We are substituting some part of China’s trade and those companies should also continue to do well.


What else do you buy and stay away from?
If you want to speculate, you can look at real estate, infrastructure which have got hammered. There are going to be opportunities but with those, there are going to be high risks. I have played a little bit in Jai Prakash Industries which is now below 5.


NBCC is in fray for JP Infra assets?
Yes. Again they are picking the assets, but at some point it does not make sense to do the deal.


Do you like cement as well?
Yes, I like cement because there is some development. The government is a big buyer of roads. So that is also happening and builders also have to finish their projects. The original builder may not own the project but some one’s going to finish it and that is also happening. So, the demand for cement is there. Certainly midcap cement looks a lot cheaper than largecap cement and therefore those are the places to buy because there will be consolidation.


What about the consumption space? Nestle earnings did not really meet the mark and analysts are very concerned that the valuations that it is demanding, is not going to sustain. How are you looking at the overall valuation scenario within FMCG or even the consumption space as a whole?
We are a nation of consumers and our incomes are going up. The consumer space is good. Nestle has got other challenges because we have got Patanjali in the works trying to undercut them on just about every single product that they have except the Maggi. Fortunately the Maggi problem is behind them because they seem to have sorted out their supply chain. That space is growing because people are moving to quality and are willing to pay a little bit more. 

But I think it is the wrong time in the cycle and so to pay 50 PE for a stock like Nestle is a challenge. But again, you are building a portfolio from the scratch. It is probably not a bad stock to own in your portfolio. It is like HDFC Bank, very highly priced but it is in everyone’s portfolios."
13,2019-02-19,Nestle,"Sharply positioning, resourcing and monitoring our activities across the geographies will provide incremental opportunities 
  
  
  for growth, Suresh Narayanan, CMD, Nestle India, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:


As expected, you have delivered on top line in Q4. Your volume-led growth strategy seems to be paying off on the domestic front. While the pace has decelerated slightly, what would you say led to the growth? Will this kind of growth trend continue going forward?
Fundamentally three things are important for us to deliver. Number one is volume-led penetration. In many of our categories, the levels of penetration are still relatively low and that is something we will focus on. 

Number two, we have considerably cranked up our pace of innovation and renovation and the last quarter was supporting these renovations and innovations very strongly. This will also be a clear engine of growth for us. 

The third element is that we have moved our organisation from pan-Indian framework to a cluster framework dividing the country into 15 clusters. Sharply positioning, resourcing and monitoring our activities across the geographies will provide incremental opportunities for growth. If we are able to put together these three things well as indeed we have for the last couple of quarters, we should be able to have a healthy performance this year as well.


Most FMCG companies spoke about benign raw material environment. But we have seen flattish gross margins delivered by Nestle, why is that?
Fundamentally, the margin structure has been impinged upon by the considerably higher level of advertising and promotion support that we have put behind the new launches in the last quarter. Almost 370 bps of extra A&P has been put to support new launches Nesplus, enhanced performance in Nescafe Gold, our chocolates and confectionary portfolio and finally also on the Maggi range. This led to the drop in the operating profit margins.

Also the benign era is gradually fading. Prices of commodities are moving northwards and our endeavour would be to try and mitigate as best as we can using our scale, science and technology, manufacturing and sourcing capabilities to mitigate some of these cost increases. Only in the most unavoidable cases, would there be consequent price increases because our core strategy remains volume-led growth and penetration-led strategies. 


You have invested a heavy amount in ad spends. While this could be an effort to maintain your double-digit volume growth, this is definitely going to hurt your margins and bottom line. How are you looking to manage the same?
We do not typically give guidance on what our EBITDA margins would be. If I am able to maintain my average levels of profitability, the way it has been for the last couple of quarters, I would consider it to be a terrific performance, seen together with strong growth on the top line that we hope to generate.


What is the average current royalty expenses as a percentage of your sales currently? I understand that SEBI allows a royalty payout of up to 2% before you have to take approval from your minority shareholders?
The royalty rates went through elaborate study in 2012 after being static for about two decades. The study was done by Mckinsey. It was validated and independently validated by Bansi Mehta & Company and also by KPMG. It was put to vote at the board meeting on the 22nd of March 2013, where the executive directors recused themselves because they were interested parties and the independent directors agreed on the lower end of the recommendation of Mckinsey and of the other two organisations, to increase it from 3.5% net of tax by 20 bps each year for five years. So, this has gone from 3.5% to 4.5% as on date and there is no proposal at the moment to increase it any further.


The contributions from new products have significantly gone up. What else do you have on your radar in terms of new launches and what is the mix between premium and the non-premium products?
One of the cornerstones has been a very strong innovation and renovation strategy. We are innovating at about three times the level of what it was pre 2015. There has been a significant uplift and also a step up as far as the innovation and renovation cycle of the company itself is concerned. 

There are at least two to three dozen projects involving a new product that are on the anvil meaning they have been worked upon and it is my hope that some of these would be launched during the course of the year. A reasonable proportion of these new products are actually premium new products that we hope will be able to address the needs, requirements and the aspirations of consumers with a more discerning expectation.
But needless to add, innovation and renovation are the key cornerstones of this company in the future.


Let us talk about Maggi. There was a faster-than-expected recovery there. When do you think you will be able to gain market share back because after that 2013 debacle, you lost market share by about 5-7%?
The market share for Maggi noodles today is at about 60% and we have already crossed the value delivery on Maggi as compared to 2014 levels in 2018. There is a small difference as far as the volume is concerned which also we are confident of taking forward in 2019. 

With a market share of 60%, we are very clearly the market leaders. This is a hyper competitive space. There are some highly respected and capable competitors and that is really what keeps the juices going as far as innovation, renovation and making that difference with an iconic brand like Maggi is going to do in the coming months and the coming years and that is exactly what you will be seeing.


You have also looked at extension of the Maggi brand into other snacking categories as well. Hoe will premiumisation and brand extension boost growth for Nestle? What kind of growth are you pencilling in here?
There are really three major vectors that will be taken up as far as Maggi is concerned; number one is variety and a closer proximity to emerging consumer taste is one part of it. Convenience, portability because a lot of consumption today is happening on-the-go and that is a huge opportunity for a company like Nestle with a brand like Maggi. 

And the third piece will really be resting around the area of value packs which is those that will be laddered in a manner to ensure that consumers are gradually moving up the value chain. In all of these, the level of differentiation, communication and the level of access that we will be putting in is of a fairly high order. 

Differentiation being the name of the game, these three vectors in terms of variety, portability and value will form the key dimensions of brand Maggi. It will not only be in noodles and in areas allied with noodles that we have a reasonably strong business in fortified flavour mixes, 

Masal-ae-magic has also been growing extremely well. We also have a sauces business which has also been doing well. So there will be many more manifestations of Maggi that you will be seeing.


You have seen very good market share gain in categories like chocolates and beverages, the ready-to-drink Nescafe as well has made great strides. What kind of growth do you see there because these are very premium products?
Chocolates and confectionaries is clearly an exciting space where with brands like Kit Kat, Munch and Milky Bar, we have made very strong inroads and with Kit Kat, we have a brand that is really extremely promising in all the avatars that it has taken in the market place. 

We have also recently launched L Atelier which is a brand of chocolates from Switzerland. These have been imported and we have launched them in the market. These are really super premium chocolates where no two pieces taste exactly the same. They are almost artisanal in terms of the way in which they have been crafted. The market very clearly is growing both in the mid market segment and also in the premium segment. 

We were not particularly active in the premium segment and that is where our activity levels have increased substantially in 2018 and you will see that in 2019. 
Coming to beverages, Nescafe is a huge opportunity for us. We have also re-launched Nescafe Gold and that has got off to a good start. We are seeing some very rapid progress happening in these brands. 

I really place a lot of innovation, renovation and growth ambitions on these three categories in the growth story for Nestle in the future."
14,2019-02-19,Nestle,"The bond market has to feel more stable and reasonable for stability to return, Gurmeet Chadha, Co-founder, Complete 
   
   
   Circle Consultants, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:


Could there be a crisis of confidence over the next few weeks?
There are some concerns which continue to linger on. I am great believer in the bond market and the yields are the lead indicator for equity markets. When the yield curve inverted, the US market saw some correction. In India, with inflation being at 2%, a rate cut by RBI and repo rate being 6.25%, the 10-year yields are still 7.50-7.60% for the government and for quasi government and AAA issue are at 8.50%. If you do the maths, you are actually borrowing 600 bps more if you take inflation at 2% which technically means you are completely crowding out the market and it is virtually shut for the private borrowers. 

These spreads have to come down for a better sense of stability to come in. In the Asian bond market, we have seen about eight big names moving from investment to junk, one of them being Bharti. The bond market has to feel more stable and reasonable for stability to return. The earnings season was good before Tata Motors surprised with that kind of a loss but one good sign is we are seeing volume growth in a few pockets. 

We are also seeing some pockets of good earnings growth whether those are corporate banks, some of the FMCG names and some of the discretionary stuff. Those are the pockets one can look at but be overweight on fixed income for now and then gradually get into equity.


We are seeing some of the metal majors moving up. We have seen brief spurts of buying across these stocks. Why do you feel it is still best to stay away from metal stocks?
If one has to be tactical, one can take some calls on the basis of tariff announcements by the government. My hypothesis is that the global macro picture is looking weak. We are staring at another global slowdown, China is 50% of the commodity demand. With that global economic backdrop, it is difficult to maintain for a sustained rise in commodity prices, but there are a few good plays and some of them are pretty attractive. Hindalco, for example, has cash on its balance sheet and at 8 PE, it is mouth watering in terms of taking some exposures. But too many variables are at play to predict the price and so this is not a market to be very adventurous. You should be at places where there is clear earnings growth, pricing power and as little regulatory intervention as possible.


What do you do with ICICI Bank, the biggest consensus trade in the street but unfortunately the stock has not quite convincingly managed to push beyond Rs 350-360. Can it be bought afresh and accumulated even at these levels?
It did go up before the entire CBI episode happened and there were a lot of views there. The market right now gets extremely wary when there is any governance issues. Even the broader portfolios, the larger mutual fund portfolios, the PMS portfolios are seeing addition of both ICICI and Axis. 

In ICICI, the de-risking continues. The retail loan book, which was 35% of the overall loan book in 2012-13, now stands at almost 55%. I expect interest and other reversals to come in with the NCLT recoveries. 

The treasury income also should be supportive with rate cut and RBI announcing an OMO on Thursday for another Rs 12,000 crore. There is a lot of focus on CASA. I keep on meeting a lot of regional and market heads and there is a lot of focus on operating parameters and growing verticals by 20%. I am extremely positive on both ICICI Bank and Axis.


What about YES Bank? Ravneet Gill is in and there was a clean chit from the RBI on divergence as well. But would you that there is still a niggling issue because RBI is alleging that full disclosures were not made. Could it go beyond a penalty or a fine?
If you have added YES Bank at about Rs 170 odd levels, you could stay put. Fresh positions right now would be a little risky considering that there could be a regulatory action. 


RBI really pulled up YES Bank, saying reporting no divergence is not an achievement, this has to be business as usual for banks. So, that event will unfold but clearly on the leadership front, on the board-room battles, on some of the other overhangs you may see some respite on those fronts. 

Their unsecured lending book is still pretty high. Unlike other banks, their NIMs are slightly lesser. Compared to an HDFC or SBI others, their NIMs are a little lower and there is some stray rumours on round tripping of some loans and some assets going on. So, you could be a little tactical. I would be taking fresh exposure because there is a regulatory overhang here but somebody who has entered at a lower level, can stay put for now. 


On ground, what is the status? How is the real estate sector shaping up? Does this move in DLF and some of the real estate stock prices, justified?
Not really and so there could be a bit of a relief rally because of the GST council meet and talks of the GST coming down from 12% to 5% and maybe slightly lesser for affordable housing. The overall scenario is still pretty grim. 

I stay in NCR and I do not see inventory levels reducing and in fact it is at an all-time high. Also there is some mild pickup on the commercial side especially properties with are rental yielding in some pockets in Noida, Gurgaon. In areas like Connaught Place, we are seeing some leasing and some commercial property transactions happening. 

But the overhang continues and there is stress. Already, some of the NBFCs with high exposure to the developers are suffering. So this is best avoided. You can be a little tactical here but that would be a trading call. 

Some of the better names in this space which are non-Delhi could be Godrej, Oberoi Realty and Sobha with better executions, low debt ratios and lesser inventory as well as great execution track record.


When it comes to the FMCG pack, there is a lot of focus on Britannia, Dabur. Is there any rationale behind it? We have seen some margin pressure on some of these names. What is the potential return one can expect on some of these counters?
The entire space is not very homogenous and I will give you two perspectives. One is from the fundamental side, which is long term and the second from immediate earnings and volume growth. 

In India the distribution reach is very understated. Cadbury in India has a 70% market share. Nestle is the world leader in confectionaries. But since Cadbury moved in earlier and had a wider distribution reach, it continues to command. Same is the case for Lever. In China, P&G moved earlier and it is the leader but in India, HUL is clearly ahead of P&G. The deep distribution network is usually understated and because the bottom of the pyramid is so deep, it becomes very difficult to dislodge somebody who has a first-mover advantage. 

Coming to Britannia, broadly 80% of the business is basically biscuits, 15% is rusk and other cakes and the balance 5% is bakery and other products. Now biscuits is a $4-billion market which I think is too less. The market will probably become 2X to 3X over next three to five years. 

On revenue side, Britannia has a market share of 21% but Parle clearly leads on the value front. So 75% revenue comes from the premium segment which is cookies which is where the leader is. For Parle, it is other way. More than 50% comes from the plain biscuits category. In the Hindi heartland where I come from, the market share is one-fifth of Parle. 

Britannia really is doing well. Their operating margins have improved from 6% some seven-eight years back to almost 14-15%. I expect the volume growth to continue double digit and so despite expensive valuations, you will see both volume and earnings growth in Britannia and some of the other names including Bata report very good numbers which is not exactly FMCG but again is a consumption story.


What is your perspective on some of the sugar names or related ethanol stories like Praj. We have seen a big move in the entire segment. Where can one find value after the recent runup in the stocks?
The MSP hike has been recent and the ethanol story is here to stay. As I said. the portfolio has to be divided into two parts -- one is fundamental which we want to probably accumulate over next few months leading up to elections and one is tactical. 

So sugar because of the MSP in ethanol, oil marketing companies (OMCs) whenever there us a reasonable correction in crude, some of the metal names we just discussed -- in this pocket, one has to be tactical. You have to decide your entry and exit levels and accordingly devise the portfolio. It is difficult to take a fundamental view because of regulatory actions now and then."
15,2019-02-21,Nestle,"NEW DELHI: The market is telling you what’s on the investor’s mind: While low PE stocks continue to bleed, so-called growth stocks have been among the top gainers in an otherwise depressed market.

Looks like investors are in no mood to chase value at the moment. And given the pre-election uncertainty, the trend is unlikely to change for now. 

The disconnect between price and value in ’growth’ and ‘value’ stocks is such that many of the growth stocks are trading at expensive valuations, even on FY2021 earnings estimates, while many value stocks are ruling at inexpensive valuations, even on FY2019 basis, said Kotak Securities. 

Out of the 49 BSE 200 stocks that have gained between 10 per cent and 60 per cent in last 12 months, half had PE multiples in excess of 40, data compiled from AceEquity suggests.

Shares of HUL and Nestle India have gained 30 per cent and 39 per cent, respectively. The two FMCG stocks have managed to sustain high price multiples in last 12 months, even as the benchmark BSE200 has declined 2 per cent in the same period. 

Shares of United Breweries are up 28 per cent; Jubilant Foodworks has gained 34 per cent and Bajaj Finance 56 per cent while Pidilite Industries, Asian Paints and Dabur India have risen up to 25 per cent in last one year.

And look at the low PE stocks: oil firms ONGC, BPCL and HPCL, power firms NTPC, REC, Power Grid, Torrent Power, NBFC stocks Dewan Housing and Reliance Capital, metals & mining companies Vedanta, Coal India and NMDC are down up to 77 per cent during this period.


What disappointed
Calendar 2019 has an even worse record: none of the 40 stocks that quoted single-digit PE as of December 31, 2018 are in the green. 

Analysts say poor returns by these stocks are either reflecting the poor growth prospects and, in many cases, concerns over corporate governance.

“Stocks quoting low PEs at this point mostly belong to heavily-indebted firms or companies with unstable earnings. As such, the pressure on stock prices are further dragging their valuations. Low PE in no way suggests a stock is cheap and that it is a better company to bet on for the future,” said Sameer Kalra of Equity Research Analyst and Founder, Target Investing.

Among the top 10 BSE200 losers so far are three ADAG group stocks Reliance Power (down 63 per cent), Reliance Infrastructure (down 62 per cent) and Reliance Capital (down 35 per cent). These stocks have been hammered after two lenders sold shares pledged with them by the promoters.

Shares of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation have dropped xx per cent. Company’s CEO Harshil Mehta resigned earlier this month. A news portal recently alleged that the NBFC was involved in a financial scam as big as Rs 31,000 crore. The company has denied any wrongdoing. 

“Certain so-called value companies have found new ways to disappoint investors on corporate governance, thereby making the valuation argument largely redundant for such stocks,” Kotak Securities said.

Graphite electrode makers Graphite India, HEG are seeing tough days as electrode prices have softened due to weak global steel prices, increased Chinese imports into India and select trade restriction placed by the US.

Adani Power and IDBI Bank have been posting losses. Nalco has seen 58 per cent plunge in Q3 earnings, while Vedanta has been in news on concerns over corporate governance.

In contrast, among the top BSE200 stocks this year are from IT sector, where firms do offer earnings guidance at the end of each quarter. Two are private lenders, and one is consumer-oriented firm (Titan Company, which too offers guidance on its jewellery business).


Smart money chases growth
Smart money will always chase growth even at the higher premium, Kalra said. “For good retail and institutional investors, growth has always been a key criteria as cleaner growth is much more sustainable. Growth is what makes them give premium valuations to stocks. Consumer stocks are a case in point. They always trade at a higher premium as they are high cash flow businesses and there is high earnings visibility. It’s easy to estimate growth simply by looking at volumes,” he said. 

Kotak Securities said: ""The market seems to have taken a permanent view on the future of most companies, thereby effectively segregating companies into long-term winners; which are companies with superior business models, trustworthy managements and good corporate governance practices where no price or valuation may be too high to own the stocks, and long-term losers; which are companies with inferior business models and poor governance practices where no price or valuation may be too low to avoid the stocks.""


Election & demand for qualityElection dates are likely to be announced over the next three weeks. In a study of past three general elections, Elara Capital found that volatility usually rises sharply ahead of Lok Sabha elections and cool off only after the election outcome. In a study of the 2004 -2018 period, the brokerage found that quality stocks tend to outperform in an uncertain market.

The brokerage says by high quality, it refers to companies with RoCE of greater than 15 in each of last five years, net debt-to-equity ratio of less than 1, positive free cash flow (FCF) yield for at least four out of last five years and net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) either stable or increasing. Within the BSE200 universe, there are 34 companies that fit the bill.

The brokerage has recommended 15 of them, which include Castrol India, Cyient, Eicher Motors, Gillette India, GSK Consumer, Infosys, ITC, Maruti Suzuki, Oracle, Sun TV Network and Tata Elxsi.

16,2019-02-26,Nestle,"Consumer-facing companies are accelerating launches over the next 4-5 months with big back-to-back events between March and June this year - the IPL T20, General Elections and ICC World Cup. The flurry of launches comes after a lull of two years that saw the roll-out of the Goods & Services Tax (GST) and demonetisation, which impacted trade channels and liquidity.

Packaged foods company Nestle plans to launch two dozen products this year, beverage maker Coca-Cola is leveraging its sponsorship rights of the ICC and IPL to launch products in the peak season for soft drinks. Britannia is entering new categories to ride the buoyant consumer sentiment in the country, while makers of televisions and air-conditioners said they have started rolling out new products and investing in advertising to leverage the upcoming season.

“We expect double-digit volume growth with consumption picking up as we are in an election year. Products launches, accelerating innovation and premiumisation of our portfolio will be our core focus,” Britannia managing director Varun Berry said. Companies are also of the view that measures announced in the interim Budget on February 1 is expected to trigger rural consumption over the next two quarters.

Chairman of Nestle, Suresh Narayanan, said at a media round table last week that his company is evaluating launching two-three dozen products across categories in 2019. The maker of Maggi instant noodles and Nescafe, which crossed the Rs 11,000-crore sales mark last year, said it is focusing on volume-led growth fuelled by over two dozen potential launches it is currently evaluating.

“We expect the consumption sentiment to improve because of multiple macro factors. We will stay focused on innovation-led volume growth. That matrix will not change for us,” Narayanan said.

Industry executives said television makers like Sony, Samsung and LG too are lining up their biggest launches this year with multiple viewing events including election. Even smartphone brands like Xiaomi, Samsung and Vivo are going ahead as per plans.

“The lingering effect of demonetisation and change over to the GST regime in last two years is waning and sentiments will definitely improve after elections,” said Sony India managing director Sunil Nayyar. World cup cricket has always boosted television sales and with signs of an early summer setting in, durables will also get a boost which will improve cash flow in the market, he said. “With so many positive indicators, we would have our highest new product launches this year”.

A report by WPP-owned GroupM released two weeks ago forecast ad spends this year will be fuelled by the Cricket World Cup and Elections, and FMCG, auto, retail, e-commerce, besides tech/telecom are expected to contribute two-thirds of the ad expenditure in 2019. The report said India now tops the list of fastest growing ad markets globally, and said India's ad investment is expected to reach an estimated Rs 80,678 crore in 2019.

Tata-owned Voltas managing director Pradeep Bakshi said there might be some a brief impact in rural and semi-urban markets during elections, but there should not be much disruption if the weather remains hot.

For beverages companies which see sales peak in April-June quarter, Coca-Cola said it will leverage its 5-year global sponsorship partnership as exclusive non-alcoholic beverages partner of the ICC till 2023, and co-presenting sponsorship for IPL, with multiple campaigns backed by launches.

FMCG firm Emami director Harsha V Agarwal said the company will line up its summer launches avoiding the election days to duck any disruption. “Launches will be postponed at most by 15-20 days. Overall, purchasing capacity tends to improve in an election year,” he said.

Some companies like Sony and Godrej are also booking advertisement space and spots from now fearing rates going up during the election time and the World Cup. Godrej Appliances business head Kamal Nandi said brands are blocking spots since it could be a challenge to get good spots later."
17,2019-02-28,Nestle,"Same government coming back, does not mean much for the market; another government coming back for temporary period might mean a bad thing but market might then end up thinking that new thinking might not be such a bad thing. So we will wait and see, said Shankar Sharma, VC & Joint MD, First Global, in an interview with Nikunj Dalmia of ET Now.
Edited excerpts:


What is happening to the world? 2018 was a shaky year. It took everything on the chin. In 2019, has world made a comeback?
World is fine. I do not think world has any problem. We can see how China has performed over the last few days. It has put behind trade tensions, trade wars. The world is a very peaceful place. I do not see any problems and I am talking about the world at large, not necessarily in our backyard. Rest of the world seems to be talking progress and economy and rates and jobs and I think the world is in a good place. US is doing very well. Russia and Brazil have performed dramatically well. China, which was a laggard, has in my view now broken out and now you will see a lot of outperformance from China. 

The world seems to be a great place to put money into equities. Even the US had a very ugly December but do you even remember that now? It has gained back pretty much everything. Even a stock laggard like Apple is now at a three-month high. So things are looking good globally.


If things are looking good globally, why is India underperforming? Global trends in 2018 were negative, but we stood tall. Now they are better, but India has to align with global reality?
As long as we are going to do all that we are doing, I do not see why India should be bucking the trend that it has seen in the last few months. It is just that stock markets like peace, calm, harmony, progress, discussions around economic issues, discussions around employment, not the stuff that we are largely discussing these days because that is a path to nowhere. Nobody got rich or prosperous discussing war and temples and stuff like that. 

So I am little worried about the discourse that we have right now, taking us away from what really the country needs and obviously we need to grow a lot faster than we are. We need to have more people coming into the employment net. We need to have companies declaring much better numbers. So we need to focus on the good things but somehow the discussion and discourse in India is a little different. If you were to question that, then obviously you yourself questioned as to why are you taking us away from what we love discussing these days which is border and tension and Pakistan and stuff like that. So, it is okay.


We both know that good news and good prices do not come together. Right now news is not very market friendly whether it is geopolitical, earnings, or the promoter front. But do you think it is time to start shopping?
My view is that some of the stocks are still fine, some are dodgy. Many corporate groups look extremely dodgy. So there is a mixed bag of players out there. Several of them have corrected which I think is great and if you are brave, you can go and buy them. But I am not prepared to make a big market call and say the worst is over. I could be very wrong on that but that is okay. I am invested. I will be happy if the market rallies and rally sharply from here on. It is just that I do not want to stick my neck out and say that worst is over and blood is on the Street and so let us go and buy some stocks! Like I said, we do not know how the stuff that is currently dominating the chatter, plays out. We do not know how all this affects the elections. 

There are many imponderables out there. I recognise the fact that sometimes market can work very differently from what people generally anticipate. I am prepared to take that risk and I would rather not stick my neck out and make a big call on where the markets are headed. But there are many stocks that look very attractive and we will stick to that.


Let us look at all the scenarios, to understand what the markets are pricing in. Scenario number one – the current government comes back into power in the current avatar. Scenario number two – the current government comes back with outside majority and third is that we see a change of guard and a new government takes over, backed by a different political party. What do you think markets are betting on?
So, let us assume the same government comes back. I do not see why that itself should mean a big upmove in the market because if the same government comes back, you will have the same policies, good or bad. I am not making a judgement on that but it will be basically more of the same. In that case, the markets will just replicate or keep going down the path they have gone for the last few years which has been not very bad, but not very good either. So it has been a mixed kind of thing. 

India has not been a huge outperformer or a huge underperformer barring of course the last couple of months. If the same government comes back, I do not see any cause for the markets to suddenly go up 20% a day because it will be the same thing being repeated all over again. 

On the other hand, if another government comes to power, the market is now left with a whole new set of things to figure out. Let us say the UPA comes back in some form, in which case the markets might say okay for a minute it is very bad news because we love the current government and any stable government or any existing government going out is generally considered to be a bad thing, but then we had 10 best years of stock market growth and the 10 best years of economic growth under the UPA. So, maybe then it is not so bad. 

Remember, in the first phase, which was the best phase of the UPA -- UPA-1 -- they had the Left to contend with and despite that we had terrific numbers. The markets in my view will sit and take a deep breath once the numbers are out and in either event, I do not think you are looking at a very substantial up move. 

If the same government comes back, I think it will be more of the same so it will just continue around the path. Other government sort of comes, it might have a down day but the markets will then sit back and re-examine past data and say it is not that bad and India’s policies for whatever they are worth will still continue and a fresh government might give you some fresh thinking. So it is a complicated question and there are no clear answers, but my sense is that the same government coming back, does not mean much for the market; another government coming back for temporary period might mean a bad thing but market might then end up thinking that maybe new thinking might not be such a bad thing. So we will wait and see.


So you are of the view that markets are unlikely to move higher in the short term, the underperformance in India is here to stay. There is a case for anxiety because of geopolitical events and because of election. What kind of picture do you think could emerge in the runup to the election? Is a 10-15% fall likely?
Of course. If you are talking 10-15%, I do not think there is anything to discuss. If you are talking a 10-15% decline in markets and you are going to put 10-15-20% of your capital, that is a pretty good area. But I do not think markets are going to decline 10-15% and that is going to be a huge fall if that were to happen! I do not think we are set up for that kind of fall unless something very drastically wrong happens at the border and you do not know how things can happen in such volatile situations. 

Leaving that aside, I do not think the markets are set for 10-15% decline. If they were to happen, there will be many stocks which will fall 30% and they have already fallen 30-40%. That means you are looking at incrementally 50-60% from the peaks. As long as you are confident of the companies’ numbers and they do not have leverage, you can put money to work in those kind of situations.


You have been a big votary of small and midcap stocks. When there is such a negative wave of selling of mid and smallcaps, how would you safeguard your small and midcap portfolio?
If anything, I am even more bullish because there are newer companies that I have seen look very good and numbers are very strong. We had stocks falling 30-40% and I have always said that this is a volatile category. If you do not have the stomach to withstand 30-40% fall on your portfolio, then you should not be in this category at all. Rather, you should not be in equities at all! Forget about smallcaps because even largecaps will take a 20% knock. 

I see any number of very good companies’ numbers for the next 12 months. After even two years in the bag, stocks are down 40-50%. I think you are going to do very well buying a number of them.


You have liked the chemical space in the past. There were a lot of chemical stocks in smallcap space which became part of the midcap space. But after the market correction, they have gone back to the smallcap space. Why do you like chemical companies, the so-called old economy B2B businesses which some would say do not have the pricing power?
The entire chemical space is very good even now. Look at companies like Vinati Organics or Aarti. These companies have been stellar performers over decades and there are many around. There is a very tiny company which I cannot name, which just in last 12 months went up 20 times. There are so many names like that. If you pick them right, it is a sector which obviously has been very volatile over the last 10-15 years because of chemical prices moving all over the place, but there has been some kind of solidity coming in.

You have to figure out these companies. I am figuring out one new company right now as we speak. It is a good overall space and that apart, there are a number of smallcap companies which do not fall into any category. I am looking at a number of them. I mean, I am very optimistic on this space.


Should one not get tempted by the price fall in NBFCs? NBFCs now have a balance sheet issue. 
Never ever say where is the bottom in financials. People keep talking about this was four times book, this is now only two times book or this was two time book and now 0.5 book. You do not have a clue what the book is! Long and short of the whole story is that off balance sheet, there are all kinds of structured transactions. It is a whole black box in terms of balance sheets of financials, not just in India, but across the world and we are probably a little better.

 In such a ,situation the book is frankly just simply calculable. When you cannot calculate the book, then why waste time calculating price to book? As for NBFCs, I have been very clear even in the boom period that they enjoyed for the last couple of years, that this is not a sector I want to put even one rupee of my capital into and nor would I advise other people to. But of course, it is up to the people to take their chances. 

It is a sector in which your cost of funds is higher than that of banks and therefore you need to find higher cost borrowers in order to make a reasonable spread. As a result, you go out there lending to people who generally have dodgy credits. That is why the real estate or promoter funding and structured transactions work well when you have a rising market. The moment you have a bear market -- and we have seen a 12 month- 13 month bear market -- the tide recedes and that is when the quality of collaterals is exposed. That is when you start demanding more cash or more collateral and that is when promoters or your borrowers simply do not have additional cash or collateral to give you. Result: your stock prices start to take hits and that is why you have seen all of them collapse. 

I was looking at the valuations of NBFCs. How can financials trade at seven times book and six times book and eight times book? This is absurd and even after correction they are like three, four times book value! I just do not think it adds up. This sector should trade at book, 1.2 book or 0.8 book. That is pretty much the range it should trade at given the risk in their core business models. 

But in an euphoria you will find these kind of companies running up a lot. They are just cooling off but I am not sure whether you have seen the bottom here.


What to your mind could be the second derivative impact of the slowdown in NBFCs? They were lending to the consumer space, retail space, the Bajaj Finances and some would argue the Cholas of the world. They have created very big consumer retail businesses. Are we in for a sizable slowdown if not in the infrastructure space, but in the consumer/consumption space?
Of course, the NBFCs were not really lending to the infra and all those sectors unless it is at the promoter level. But they have lent a lot to real estate and that we all know is in deep strife and a reasonably large part of the consumer boom in India that we have seen in the last three, four years, has been funded by NBFCs. People are not extending credit anymore because whatever the inflows are is simply going to pay off the liability. No net new credit is being created by NBFCs in aggregate. That will have a knock-off effect on consumption for sure. 

You will see that happen and the stock market did what it did because of the consumption story and not because of any other part of the story. If that slows down, we have a little bit of a pickle on the earnings momentum part.


Is India in a Jekyll and Hyde kind of a situation where the good news is that we have corrected, valuations are looking reasonable but the negative part is that we have got elections, we do not have a proper earnings recovery to keep the consumption engine going while the investment engine will keep us dragging down?
India has been a very confusing market. In the last six months, there have been equal number of times when I have thought that India is breaking out and is putting all the problems behind it. Just when I start to get a little confident, it just kind of reverses, including as recently this morning, from where we started to then what it did during the day, it has been just impossible to get a very clear line of sight into where India is going. 

On the balance, it does look that it will lag its peers in the emerging market space, that is at least my reading so far. The tape is telling you that. But like I said, it has been all over the place in the last few months time and it is very hard to say that India is an outperformer or India is an underperformer.


You always say a bull market is on somewhere in the world. Where do you think the bull market is on and what should be the right asset allocation?
Emerging markets look very good. They have underperformed quite a bit but they are coming back. US looks very, very good. By and large, equity looks good and is not in trouble at all. You would see the periodic corrections of the kind we saw in December in the US but I am very optimistic on global equities and within that, the EMs look the best because they have lagged a lot of and with China now sort of coming back, EMs look very good. I am very optimistic on emerging markets equities. 


You are a great tape reader, you do not look at valuations or pricing but you look at the screen and the tape. What is the screen telling you?
Well that is what the tape is saying. I mean, do not take my word for it, you just have to go and see. The tape and data is pretty clear that -- and that’s a little bit of a concern and disappointment -- because usually India is a very robust market in good times and in bad times. The world is going along pretty okay. In that situation, India should have been blowing out the lights. That we are not, is a matter of disappointment for me both as an Indian and as an investor.


Which is the one big regret you have about your investing career? Which is that one big asset allocation or stock purchase or stock transaction you would like to reverse? Hand on your heart. you would say oh I did a mistake otherwise I would have been a billionaire?
It is very straightforward, I should have bought all the MNCs in India in the 90s which were trading at 60 times earnings onwards to 150 times earnings. Gillette Shaving Products was trading at a 150 times earnings and Lever was the cheapest, trading at 60 times earnings. Everything else -- Nestle and the others were trading between 60 and 150. I thought they were very expensive and never bought them. In hindsight I should have-- that was a big mistake. We should have loaded up on them believing that India will always be expensive towards so- called higher quality companies. I somehow could not ever believe that even for quality you should be paying 60 or 150 times earnings, but I was clearly wrong."

It is fairly unpredictable time for the equity markets but what exactly is the portfolio strategy at this juncture?
The strategy has been the same for a long time. We follow businesses where we understand the companies and the industries very well, trust the managements for running the businesses very well and treating the shareholders fairly. At the same time, we also want companies which have a long tailwind in terms of the businesses they operate in. If they are available at reasonable price, they stay in the portfolio. If not, we can stay in cash. We can invest abroad and that strategy has been playing out since the fund has started. 


Since the last time we spoke, you have added Amazon. A small portion but it’s a fresh investment. What pushed you to finally go out and buy into Amazon?
We have been tracking Amazon as a business for long and we have seen it evolve dramatically. But again, when you go back to the traditional metric of business valuation, you always have seen Amazon to not show the accounting profits the way other companies do and we realised that okay it is our misunderstanding that accounting profits may not be the only thing to understand, maybe economic profits are something that we need to figure out. 

In the midst of this, Amazon started the cloud computing business. It also started its internal Amazon advertising business although the advertising business has not broken out in the top line numbers that they provide. But cloud business is the profit driver for the company and we have since then understood the cloud business a little bit better than in the past and that led us to believe that Amazon is no longer just a retail company. It is also a retail advertising and a cloud computing business.


What would make you increase your stake in it as opposed to the half a per cent exposure that you currently have?
One thing is valuations and secondly as more data keeps coming in, it makes the conviction even stronger if the idea is worthy to be in the portfolio or not.


And you mentioned that when it comes to the consumption sector? You can look to nibble in at reasonable valuations. What is the current exposure and what the outlook is for the sector fundamentally?
The only two consumption stocks in the portfolio are Zydus Wellness and Nestle Global. It is purely because of valuation and the businesses that they operate in. The frontline consumer stories are still very expensive. We will wait. Those are preferred businesses we want to own but we do not want pay very high price for that.


The market has been range-bound so far with a continuous overhang of elections. Would you say that a) it has been a show of resilience by the market and b) how best do you deploy in the next two months before the elections? Are there stocks on your watch list or some stocks that you already own in your portfolio where you feel that if the valuation were to drop or prices were to come down, you would add more?
Last year was a very difficult time for us because we already were studying a lot of businesses but had nothing to buy because the valuations just went out of hand. This year has been a little bit better where some of our existing portfolio companies are looking attractive and we are adding to them. At the same time, newer companies which were already on the grocery list that we wanted to buy.


What have you added to?
The existing companies -- Persistent Systems, some pharma companies and all the other stocks that we own, some banks. We have added wherever the valuations were reasonable and we kept on tracking the companies and they are no longer out of reach. We will restrict ourselves to 25 companies in the portfolio and it is going to be an opportunity cost kind of a thing.


What gives you conviction about Persistent though the numbers and the earnings performance have been a little volatile?
It has been quite stagnant, not volatile also. It is not growing at the same rate as the industry is growing. The only thing is they are in an industry where the volume of work continues to increase every year and they are in a particular business area where they have an advantage compared to other companies. They do not have the legacy business to manage on the same scale as the larger IT companies or some of the midcap IT companies. 

They are not system integrators, they are basically product developers and they will basically outsource product development for any enterprise client who is willing to give them the opportunity. Their problem is that the sales engine has not been firing at the same pace as the rest of the industry. We will have to wait and see but we trust the management to deliver on that front, let us see."
2,2019-03-05,Nestle,"Private banks and cement companies are where money would flow in said, Gurmeet Chadha, Co-Founder, 
Complete Circle Consultants, in an interview with ET Now. Also, one can be selective in consumption and tactical in OMCs, says Chadha. Edited excerpts: 


What is it that the market is pricing in? It seems this is a pre-election cheer which is coming in a tad too early?
It is a little early to call it pre-election cheers but what has happened is that while the entire market continues to focus on the geopolitical risk, a lot of other risks which the market was concerned about have abated a little bit. 

2018 was a year when we had some central banks hiking rates like in US and some of the emerging markets like India and Indonesia. There were some central bankers who were more accommodative. Probably this year you will see all central bankers being more accommodative. US is already indicating a pause in balance sheet contraction. India has already had a rate cut. China has now guided for lower end of the GDP at 6%. You could see both monetary and fiscal stimulus there. 

You will probably have a synchronised central bank accommodative stance this year which is positive for EMs. Also the threat of a full-blown trade war seems to have abated a little bit. Also India has really underperformed the EM basket. The emerging market index is up 11-12%. China is almost 18-20% up and we had underperformed. So. it could be a bit of catching up as well.


Which are those names which you would like to be part of your portfolio? Any particular segment within housing finance companies where you are more optimistic?
In the housing finance space, we have to differentiate the balance sheets. It looks to be a homogenous space, but it is not. A lot of the names have been under pressure -- the likes of Edelweiss or Repco or even Motilal because of their Aspire incurring losses. 

In case of L&T Finance, 60-65% of the book is mortgaged. The balance is developer loans and LAP. Also, NHP does not regulate HFCs as strongly as RBI does for some of the others in terms of banks. I also expect more regulation to come in once this crisis is fully taken care of. 

Within the HFC space, one safe bet is HDFC Limited. They have about six million homes which they have financed. They have a right combination of consumer and institutional book. Even if you see the institutional book, they are more focussed. The growth is coming from the lease rental discounting and construction finance and not much from the corporate loans to developers. We are a little selective here. I would consider something like a Can Fin in HFCs, where 80% of the book are linked to the salaried class, which again are mostly government employees. 

We have to watch out on the liability side. It should be more granular and on the lending side, the exposure to developer loans and the LAP should be a little lower. On consumer finance, the obvious position which I have been maintaining for long is Bajaj Finance. 


You seem to be betting on NCC. What kind of potential do you see over here? What is the long-term target price and do you believe now is a good time to enter?
We are positive on three fronts. They have a order book of more than Rs 34,000 crore, even in last quarter, they had a good EBIT with 12% margin. Most of these orders are government PSU backed. It is one of the largest construction companies right now. 

The only concern is the working capital days which is about the highest in the industry. Their receivable days are about 200 vis-à-vis about 120 for the industry. The safer bet could be L&T in the largecap space which is not necessarily construction, but the entire engineering construction -- the ECC space. In Q4, they have guided for almost Rs 40,000-50,000 crore of order book and in the first nine months, they were at about Rs 1.2 lakh crore.

If they have a Rs 40,000-50,000-crore order book, they will be on course to hit about 10% to 12% growth in orders and the good part is that there is improvement across the metrics. It is not only in terms of the diversification of orders. There are orders from hydrocarbons and refineries because the oil prices have been a little better. There are airports, water supply and they have this time re-categorised the orders into broadly four categories -- which is significant, large, major and mega. I am not really talking about the small orders which are Rs 1,000 crore. There is improvement in working capital cycle as well. So, in this space, we are fairly positive on largecap L&T and midcap NCC.


Tata Motors clocked it is best single day gain in about three years’ time. Do you think Tata Son’s business rejig to cut costs, the fact that they have assured that JLR turnaround is round the corner and the kind of rebound that we have seen in the Feb auto sales would that give you conviction to be a medium or long-term buyer in Tata Motors?
It is interestingly placed. If you see its sales breakup, the passenger cars actually grew 2% in Feb where the CV and the overall business was down. In case of JLR also, the US sales were up about 29%. If you add Germany, Italy and US and put together as a cluster minus China, it grew about 16%. 

There is lot of action in terms of ramping up their I-PACE model. There are couple of more SUV models on the Range Rover platform. So it will be an interesting space to watch out and I think Tata Motors has been attractive sub-200 for a long, long time. 

I think what has happened is that every quarter you had some disappointment or the other. I would like to watch out for Brexit and the China factor because that is where the high margin because US is mostly low margin sales. China is where they have the higher margin as well as volumes sales coming up. So, maybe with news of China cutting 3% VAT on manufacturing, there could be a slight improvement in their China sales.

In domestic business, the response to Harrier and some of the new SUVs which they are coming is quite good in terms of their dealer checks we have done. So it is an interesting one. If you want to buy it right now, maybe 20% now and then wait for a quarter and then maybe gradually accumulate.


Would you buy into Eicher sub Rs 20,000? The stock has recovered much from there and seeing a big move today?
A lot of pain was in the price when the stock was at around Rs 19,000 and sub 19,000. The numbers of February were also a little disappointing as it was approximately 64,000 units versus 70,000 which this fleet was expecting. If you look at it, the strike in one of their plants meant a loss of 3,000 units. So, it is a larger trend which is playing out here. I will not be a buyer right now on Eicher. I will try to wait and watch because I like to see two trends here, one is their new models which are at the 650 cc which is the Interceptor and the Terminator.

Also often not discussed is the commercial vehicle segment and they have some good technology in the medium weight commercial vehicles. We probably will have to see whether the CV cycle is on the downturn or it is a temporary phase. But it is good to add on dips. You can wait and watch for now on some of these auto names, but as I said lot of pain is in the price.


How are you playing the consumption theme? Do you believe that within the consumption space, you would tend to be very selective?
I would be. Every election in India is like a mini QE (quantitative easing). You see the cash in circulation goes up. It has already gone above the pre-DeMo level and a lot of the parallel side of the economy comes into the mainstream with the kind of spending we see.

We are already seeing government transferring about Rs 28,000 crore to the farmers which is part of the basic income support. There will be more loan waivers and as you get closer to election, there will be probably a lot of spending by the political parties. So. that makes me positive. 

There are two-three spaces I like here. The FMCG packs stands out, I like Nestle and HUL in the staples. Nestle is likely to launch about 13 t0 15 new products, you could have a topline growth of 15% after a long, long time and followed by a margin expansion or may be 80 to 100 bps. So, that looks attractive. 

HUL has come off a little bit in the last previous trading sessions. The food and the beverage segment after the acquisition would give them the distribution reach to add on to those gains so positive there. 

I also like some niche consumption plays which are like the pressure cooker and the kitchenware makers like a TTK prestige the market itself will probably grow 3 to 4x as rural areas are only 20-30% penetrated. 

I also like some of the while we have spoke about Info Edge right and Zomato probably the unlisted space has an advantage on the food aggregator side but I like Jubilant for the fact that there has been a good price correction. They are cutting down on their Dunkin Donuts outlets which did not pan out well. They have already cut down from 70 to about 35. The same store growth is about 20-21% and they are now venturing into the Chinese Kitchen which will probably give them some variety to take on to these food aggregator so those are some of the ideas in the space.


How would you approach not just OMCs but also some of the other names like ONGC and some of the gas names like MGL, IGL?
There are two parts to the portfolio. One is buy to hold which is your HDFC and Bajaj Finance and Asian Paints of the world and one is buy to sell. A lot of these OMCs, some of the PSU names you spoke about possibly fall there. One has to be a little tactical in OMCs. HPCL for example at sub-200 was a good buy. It was almost book value. 

Also we have to look at the marketing infrastructure. Some of these are virtually oligopolies. There are chances of obvious government regulating through tinkering with excise duties and subsidies. HPCL, in particular, is one of the largest lube based refineries in India. If I were to be a little tactical here, I will probably pick up HPCL. 

You are right about the city gas distributors. MGL looks very, very good. We are already seeing three-wheeler sales turning positive for most of the auto makers even in February. So domestic connections, increasing three wheelers moving to the CNG and slightly lesser regulation in the gas space compared to petrol and diesel, gives them an edge. 

But again you have to be more tactical here. Some of the other PSU names where you can be a little tactical is NTPC. It is trading at about 11 times. It has a good dividend yield. The coal production is up by almost 7% after a long time. The dispatches are up about 3%. It is a virtual monopoly play. This is almost like 7-8% dividend yield on it. So maybe that part of the portfolio could be looked at, but as I said tactically.


In the next leg of the rally, where do you think the contribution is going to come in from sectorally?
If you see the overall report which has come last year on the entire banking sector, the private corporate banks are getting the bulk of the flows. If you look at for example current accounts, the share of PSU bank has even fallen from 58% last year to 54%. In deposits, they are losing market share and by deposits I mean saving, current and term deposits. 

Once you lose current account share, it basically means that cash management is being handed over to the private banks. The corporate loan fund are going to the private banks which affects the PSU banks’ trade, their fx income and it has a cascading impact on their overall fee and interest income. 

So they will continue to gain market share and bankex typically grows one and a half times GDP. If private banks can gain market share, probably they will grow at 15% to 18% as a category. Also, the credit cost is likely to come off by 100 bps for private banks largely led by ICICI and Axis. Now on a large base, a 1% reduction in credit cost would translate to Rs 5,000-7,000 crore of bottom line movement. That is one space which is looking very good. 

Some of the construction names we have discussed in the capital goods space looks good. Cement valuations look very, very attractive. There have been a price hike of Rs 50 to Rs 60 on an average in south, about Rs 30-40 in other parts of the country. Good picks here could be Shree Cement which is largely north based and ACC as well because the stock has been a little under pressure due to having older splant and some of the clinker capacities are not really coming through. So, these are the broad sectors, which liquidity would chase."
1,2019-03-05,Nestle,"Veteran stock market investor Chandrakant Sampat, often referred to as India’s original value investor, died at the age of 86 in Mumbai in early 2015.

But his value investing style, investment philosophy and wisdom remain alive in the hearts of many of his younger followers and some of the best minds on Dalal Street. An inspiration to several of today’s investment gurus, including Radhakishan Damani, Sampat made a powerful and everlasting impression as a master value investor.


Sampat’s road to gloryA man who preferred to stay away from the media glare, Sampat made his wealth by identifying investment opportunities in the 1950s after quitting his family business in 1955. Over the years, he made a mark as a man of resolute and rigorous discipline.

Sampat had a knack for holding stocks for decades, an investment practice that is unlikely to strike a chord with even the most patient of investors in today’s market. He amassed enormous wealth from years of careful investing by picking multibaggers from among multinational stocks. With the introduction of Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, or Fera, in the 1970s, which forced foreign firms to dilute equity at prices lower than their intrinsic values, Sampat quickly picked up multibaggers like Gillette (then Indian Shaving Products), Nestle and Hindustan Unilever even before they became investor favourites. 

Before buying a stock, Sampat would weigh it on a rigorous scale of productivity and innovation. The constituents of his portfolio were constantly challenged against his metric and any stock that failed to meet the standards was removed from his portfolio instantly.

 An avid follower of the Bhagwad Gita, Sampat often quoted shlokas from the great Indian epic and also condemned the conventional social system which he felt restricted the mind. “Markets and mistakes are best education. India’s conventional education just closes one’s mind,” he once said in an address to investors.


Drucker’s impact in Sampat’s lifeOne man who greatly influenced Sampat’s thought process and deeply inspired him was Peter F Drucker. Sampat frequently quoted him and was generally in agreement with the theories that Drucker has propounded.

Echoing Drucker’s perspective, Sampat once said, “If we achieve profit at the cost of downgrading or not innovating, they are not profit. We are destroying capital. On the other hand, if we continue to improve productivity of all key resources and our innovative standing, we are going to be profitable not today, but tomorrow. In looking at knowledge applied to human work as a source of wealth, we also see the function of the economic organization.”


Sampat's golden rule of investment Sampat’s high success rate in the stock market can be attributed to the fact that he studied the fundamentals of a company clearly before making an investment decision. He followed some investment principles religiously, which helped him make great investment decisions and stay ahead of his peers. Leading modern-day investors still follow his investment advice to build multibagger portfolios.


Invest in businesses with little debtAn advocate of value and long-term investing, Sampat gave a lot of importance to free cash flow and longevity of a business for wealth creation. Also, he would advise investors to put money in a business that they had some knowledge about with either zero or very little debt.

“Invest in a business you understand, the company should have either zero or very little debt, the share should be available at a P/E ratio of 13 to 14 times current year’s earnings and lastly, it should be available between 3.5 and four per cent yield,” he used to say.


Pick good managements with share prices at 10-year low Sampat was of the view that investors should pick shares of companies with good managements, when share prices are at an eight-year or 10-year low. He was a great endorser of the FMCG stocks and advised investors to pick stocks with least capital expenditure, where the return on capital employed should not be less than 25 per cent.

“Pick up good companies with good managements when their share prices are at an eight-year or 10-year low. Alternatively, if you still want to do something, buy stocks of good companies that are 40 per cent lower than their 52-week highs. I will buy only those companies that are in a business that even fools can understand, have very little debt, have free cash flows and do not have much capital expenditure, which is nothing but deferred cost,” he often said.


Keep expenses low Sampat also advised investors to keep their expenses low and invest only in a few companies and keep faith in the power of compounding.


When Sampat turned bearish on marketTowards the latter part of his investment journey, Sampat became bearish on the stock market and kept most of his wealth in cash or cash equivalents. “There was a time when I had 70 per cent of my net worth invested in equity. Times have changed,” he remarked.

Sampat had deliberately stayed away from investing in the stock market as he grew critical of the policies followed by global central banks that had led to the rise in asset prices. Sampat was also unhappy with deteriorating corporate governance standards of Indian firms.

Sampat’s pessimism was also due to the fact that he wasn’t confident about the state of the Indian economy and thus, the fate of the corporate sector. He was worried about India’s growing fiscal deficit and felt that there was a scarcity of worthwhile investment options as many companies listed on the stock exchanges had negative EVA (economic value added).


Accelerating rate of technology threatening capital markets Another major global trend that Sampat was worried about was the accelerating rate of technology that was threatening the survival of capital markets. According to Sampat, technological innovation was resulting in shorter business cycles, which were leading to shorter life spans for companies.

He believed in order for companies to survive this technology boom, they needed to generate cash flows in order to ensure that they were prepared for any new development that could alter the way businesses were running. This, Sampat felt, would leave lesser or no scope for capital formation as money would be used only for new technology and companies that were stuck with outdated technology would fail to survive. This, Sampat feared, could lead to a debacle for the capital market in the future.

And given his years of experience and amazing success in the stock market, even the best names on Dalal Street did not dismiss Sampath’s views or betted against them without giving it a second thought."

The Nifty50 on Wednesday managed to hold above 11,000 level and gradually extended its gains towards the 11,060 zone. It continued the positive momentum into the third consecutive session and formed a bu llish candle on daily scale, as intraday dips got bought into.

The index managed to see a consolidation breakout with strong momentum on the last trading sessions and now followup buying suggests the bulls are back on track. Now, Nifty has to hold above 10,985 level to extend its move towards 11,118 and then 11200 levels, while on the downside, support exists at 10,929 and then 10,888 levels.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest was at 11,000 followed by 10,800 levels, while maximum Call OI was at 11,500 followed by 11,000. Meaningful Put writing was seen at 11,000 while there was Call writing at 11,400 followed by 11,300 levels. The option band signalled a trading range between 10,888 and 11,200 levels. India VIX fell 0.32 per cent to 15.61 level. Now, it has to hold below 16-15 zone to get the smooth ride in the market.

Bank Nifty formed a Doji candle on the daily scale as it remained dull after showing strong momentum in the last session. The index closed near its opening level, but dips got bought into, which indicated an overall positive bias in this sector.

Now, the index has to hold above 27,350 to witness an upward move towards 27,750 and then 28,000 levels, while on the downside support exists at 27,150 followed by 27,000 levels.

3,2019-03-06,Nestle,"Sustained inflows from institutional investors and easing of tensions between India and Pakistan aided benchmark equity indices to rally over 1 per cent on Tuesday.

The buoyancy in market sentiment is clearly evident since last few sessions, and midcaps and smallcaps have come to the forefront and started outperforming. 

The market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms soared by over Rs 4 lakh crore to Rs 144.24 lakh crore in just four sessions. As the domestic market is getting ready for the next rally, investors on Dalal Street are trying to accumulate stocks of fundamentally strong businesses that are quoting at cheaper valuations. 

Analysts are advising investors to hunt value in select private sector banks, cement majors, housing finance companies (HFC), FMCG and real estate stocks.

“Within the HFC space, one safe bet is HDFC. It has financed about six million homes. It has the right combination of consumer and institutional books. On the institutional book, they are more focussed. Every election in India is like a mini quantitative easing. You see the cash in circulation goes up. The FMCG packs stands out, Nestle and HUL look attractive in the space, Gurmeet Chadha, Co-Founder, Complete Circle Consultants said.""

Chadha said he also likes niche consumption plays, like kitchenware maker TTK prestige. 

Overseas money is again returning to the Indian equity market. Foreign investors bought shares worth over Rs 17,200 crore on a net basis in February this year, the highest since November 2017, amid clarity on government spending plans and positive sentiments.

Foreign portfolio investors had pumped in a net of Rs 19,728 crore into domestic stocks in November 2017. Chadha said private sector banks as well as cement players are also looking attractive.

“Private corporate banks are getting bulk of the flows. Market share of PSU banks has fallen from 58 per cent last year to 54 per cent in terms of current account. In deposits, they are losing market share in both current and term deposits. Once you lose current account share, it basically means cash management is being handed over to private banks. Private sector banks will continue to gain market share,” he said. 

Retail prices of cement soared in February, with the hike at pan-India level estimated at Rs 24-25 per bag (50 kg) in the last week of the month compared with the corresponding week of January. The southern region saw the steepest hike, at Rs 52 per bag in Bangalore, Rs 62 per bag in Chennai, and Rs 77 per bag in Hyderabad.

Rahul Prithiani, Director, CRISIL Research, “Margins of cement players have been contracting for past two years, and are estimated to shrink by 150-200 basis points this financial year at 16-16.5 per cent. With modest growth in realisation and cost deflation, we expect the trend to reverse next financial year, with the industry likely to log healthy expansion of 150-250 basis points. The election outcome and its impact on demand growth would be key monitorables for sustenance of prices and, thereby, profitability.”

Brokerage firm ICICIdirect on March 5 maintained a ‘buy’ rating on ACC with a price target of Rs 1,750.

Global brokerage CLSA is positive on select real estate players. The foreign brokerage believes the organised developers’ market share could double from 8-10 per cent to 20 per cent over the next five years, delivering some 30 per cent sales growth CAGR. 

“High-quality developers, with a greater focus on the residential market, will benefit disproportionately from this cyclical upturn. Our top picks are Godrej Properties, Sobha, Prestige Estates and Oberoi Realty,” it said.

Overall, midcaps and smallcaps have outperformed their largecap counterparts with wider margin during February 26-March 5 as investors’ strategy seems to have changed from sell on rally to buy on dips due to attractive valuations.

BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices have advanced 4.24 per cent and 6.40 per cent, respectively, in last four sessions, while BSE Sensex gained 1.30 per cent.

“After the recent correction, premium valuations of midcaps and smallcaps vis-a-vis largecaps have normalised and, hence, value buying seem to be emerging,” said Devang Mehta, Head-Equity Advisory, Centrum Wealth Management."
6,2019-03-12,Nestle,"NEW DELHI: Matrix partners and Sauce VC have teamed up to invest $1 million (about Rs 7 crore) in &Me, a food and beverage brand founded by Stanford business school alumnus Ankur Goyal.

The investors have subscribed to new shares in &Me’s parent company Merhaki Foods and Nutrition, RoC filings show. Bengaluru-based &Me manufactures food products and beverages exclusively for women that serve their health, nutrition and fitness needs.

Its products include liquids that relieve PMS symptoms such as cramps and also provide relief for patients suffering from polycystic ovary syndrome. “We are determined to solve many such challenges for women in the most convenient, healthy and tasty formats,” Goyal said.

This is Matrix’s second investment in the company after it led a seed round in August last year. “&Me’s core differentiator lies within its exceptional product and brand positioning that targets urban Indian women whose daily lifestyle denies them benefits of essential micronutrients,” Matrix India’s vice president Sanjot Malhi said.

Matrix’s estimates place the size of the functional foods and beverages market in India at $1 billion. Sauce VC is a consumer-focused fund launched by former 3i private equity executive Manu Chandra who has been an early backer of companies such as yogurt maker Epigamia, in which French dairy giant Danone recently bought a stake.

&Me will use the fresh funding to expand its team and scale operations nationally apart from widening its product offering. Its products are currently distributed through modern retail chains in southern India such as Nilgiri’s, Godrej Natures Basket and Namdhari. The products are also sold online through ecommerce sites such as Amazon.

Goyal, who has previously worked with consumer brands like Nestle and PaperBoat, launched &Me two years ago. Matrix manages $1 billion of investments in India. It has been an early investor in several market leading companies such as Ola, Quikr, Dailyhunt, Treebo, Razorpay and Ziploan."

9,2019-03-14,Nestle,"MUMBAI: Unilever named Nitin Paranjpe global chief operating officer as part of a leadership rejig that also saw the India unit’s chairman Sanjiv Mehta being appointed president of South Asia and a member of the Unilever Leadership Executive (ULE).

The world’s second-biggest consumer goods major said these changes, effective May 1, will help continue its transformation into a faster, leaner and more agile company.

Paranjpe, 56, became the head of Unilever’s foods and refreshment business last year after the Anglo-Dutch company completed the merger of the two segments to create its largest business unit. Mehta, who was executive vice president for Unilever South Asia, will continue as Hindustan Unilever’s chairman. 



“Today’s increasingly fragmented consumer, channel and media environment requires us to operate with more speed and agility than ever before. With his deep knowledge and experience of our markets, Nitin is ideally placed to work with me and the Unilever Leadership Executive to drive our performance and help deliver our growth ambitions,” said Unilever CEO Alan Jope.

“Sanjiv has been one of our most impressive general managers with a consistent track record of growth and execution in high-growth and emerging markets. He has been instrumental in unlocking strong performance in South Asia, delivering exceptional top and bottom line growth.”

Paranjpe is Unilever’s second Indian-origin COO after the post was created in June 2011 and occupied by Harish Manwani until his retirement in 2014. The number of Indian managers has been increasing steadily at Unilever over the past few years with more than 200 currently serving the company globally in key leadership roles.

As India’s biggest consumer goods company, HUL is regarded as a proxy for consumer sentiment in the country. India is the second-largest market for Unilever after the US, contributing more than 9% to total sales and more than a fourth of its market capitalisation.

The elevation of Indian executives, many with stints in the local unit, reflects the increasing importance of the country for multinationals including Unilever as markets in the West hit a plateau. India particularly is an important destination for these companies, given its prime demographics and faster population growth.

Analysts said HUL could get extra focus from the parent company with more Indians on its leadership committee. “It is a positive for HUL, which will now get increased investment in terms of research and development, more global brand rollouts and also shows the importance of HUL and its employees within Unilever,” said Abneesh Roy, senior vice president, institutional equities, Edelweiss Securities. “The also puts Paranjpe as the key contender for the top CEO post in future.”

Paranjpe, who joined Unilever’s Indian unit Hindustan Lever (now Hindustan Unilever) in 1987 as a management trainee, has risen rapidly through the ranks. He was the youngest CEO at the Indian unit of the consumer giant and had a successful fiveyear tenure at the helm of HUL before he moved to his current role as president of the home care business in 2013. Under his watch, annual revenue grew to .`26,000 crore from .`16,000 crore in the period.

With the latest development, Mehta will join Leena Nair, Unilever’s chief human resource officer, and Paranjpe as the third Indian manager to be part of the ULE.

In his six years at the helm, Mehta, a chartered accountant by training, has increased HUL’s sales from.`25,810 crore in 2013 to .`35,787 crore now. That’s over .`10,000 crore in incremental sales, or about the size of Nestle or P&G’s overall business in India. Under him, HUL’s share price has trebled to .`1,737 apiece on the BSE, up from .`600 in October 2013 when he joined."
8,2019-03-14,Nestle,"The positive momentum in domestic equities is doing all the talking. This has prompted global brokerages to raise target price of stocks from across sectors. 

Take this. In the real estate space, CLSA upgraded DLF to ‘Buy’ from ‘Sell’ and upped target to Rs 229 from Rs 167 earlier, expecting the leasing business to deliver double-digit growth with a stable balance sheet. 

The foreign firm reasoned that the development business has achieved stability and higher price target reflects higher value for land-bank and a lower capital rate. 

After falling nearly 32 per cent in 2018, shares of DLF have advanced 5 per cent this year so far. 

Info Edge India, an online classifieds company in recruitment, matrimony, real estate, education and related services, got an upgrade to ‘Buy’ from HSBC as against ‘Reduce’ last week, with a target price of Rs 1,978 from Rs 923 earlier. 

“Given that all the major segments of the business have seen a marked improvement or changes over the last year and a half, we are upgrading Info Edge to ‘Buy’ from ‘Reduce’,” HSBC said in a report.

India's biggest carmaker Maruti Suzuki is also on the radar of brokerages due to a softer interest rate. While retaining a ‘Buy’ call on Maruti, Citi recently increased target price to Rs 8,300 from Rs 7,600 before. The foreign firm sees a slight pick-up in volume post elections. 

“We believe that earnings downgrades could trough over 2019-20,” Citi said.

Similarly, Pidilite Industries, popularly known for its brand Fevicol, has seen an upgrade in its target price to Rs 1,125 from Credit Suisse versus Rs 950 earlier. While maintaining a ‘Neutral’ call on the company, Credit Suisse said gross margins should see a significant improvement from the March quarter. It saw price hikes and lower input cost aiding margins.

In the FMCG space, CLSA upped target price of Nestle to Rs 11,750, from Rs 11,500 earlier. According to the brokerage house, the annual report shows advertisement spend of Nestle is at a 15-year high with return ratios at a multi-year high. “Management commentary suggests that virtuous cycle of growth has begun at Nestle,” CLSA said.

Citi has also effected a hike in target price for Dilip Buildcon to Rs 761 (Rs 725 earlier), citing improvement in the balance sheet with net debt to equity guidance of 0.7-0.8 times in 2019-20. The management of Dilip Buildcon expects significant order wins in the second half of the next financial year. 

Overall, domestic equity markets advanced over 2 per cent in the past two trading sessions, driven by positive factors such as sustained foreign capital inflows, a stronger rupee, and chances of the incumbent NDA government getting a second term. 

On a net basis, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) pumped in net Rs 2,477.72 crore on Tuesday while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) turned net sellers to the tune of Rs 990.48 crore, provisional data available with BSE showed."

  o Infosys and Tech M, said Gurmeet Chadha, Co-founder, Complete Circle Consultants, in an interview with ETNOW. Edited excerpts:


Now that a resolution seems pretty likely, the quantum of recoveries would definitely be quite large for banks with exposure to Essar Steel. What is your view?
We will have to wait till March 27 for absolute numbers but obviously there will be a big positive also. It will have a rub-off effect on some of the other cases also. We keep talking about whether the PSU banks are a good play or not. The biggest fintech app in the country is 59-minuteloan.com. I was tracking the figures and they have sanctioned loans worth Rs 30,000 crore within such a short period of being launched. The disbursal is Rs 24,000 crore. There is an interesting play here. One can incrementally add some positions in some of the top PSU banks like SBI and BoB. They are still at about 1-1.5 book value. 


What is the sense that you are getting about the IT space? Given the way the currency is faring, what would it mean not only for IT, but also some of the other exporters?
It would be wrong to put everything in one basket in terms of the currency impact. For every 1% impact on the currency, the margin gets eroded by about 20-25 bps but within the pack, you should also see that there is a lot of localised initiatives being done. The digital deal win momentum is very good. Something like Infosys has a valuation discount to TCS at this price. The BFSI vertical is looking good. 

In Tech Mahindra, even the telecom vertical has shown month on month upside in terms of the business being generated. So I will not be very negative on IT. One has to be selective here. So, maybe an Infosys and Tech Mahindra for me in this pack. You may not want to add incremental positions but may be you want to stay on with these names for some time. 


We have been looking at different pockets. But where would you be looking to buy at lower levels? 
A couple of them actually. Agrochemicals, for example is a niche space, we like it a lot considering that we are seeing a lot of rural thrust by the government. In agrochemicals, India has one of the lowest penetration levels. One stock which we like in this space is UPL. Post the Arysta acquisition, that story seems to be over now. 

Post this, there will be about $5 billion of sale with about a crore of EBITDA. If you see their revenue mix, almost 35% or a third of it comes from herbicides which is a very high volume and high margin business. In the next two to three years, about $3 billion worth of products will become off patent in the US. That brings a very good opportunity and if you track the company, it has a very high ROCE business and high EBITDA margins. They are consistently at about 22-23% ROCE. So, it is a very good business to look at in this space. 

We also like some of the consumer staple names and low ticket consumer durables which will have an impact as consumption picks up in the next quarter. We like Nestle in the staple pack. With the dealer check we have done, we have seen volume pickup in beverages and chocolates. They have been struggling to gain market share in chocolates, especially with respect to Cadbury’s. There is a marginal improvement there. There is a market share gain even in the prepared dishes and despite these valuations, we like that name. 


Have you bought anything a fresh in the March rally?
Adding on to the banks -- both ICICI and Axis. One interesting study with some of the other brokerages showed that even in deposits, especially in current accounts, we are seeing a market share loss for PSU banks. The deposit growth last year for PSU banks was 8% and the private banks was 22%. Now in current accounts they have lost market share from 58% to 54%. 

Now being a banker, a current account share loss means that your cash management and corporate loan funds are going to private banks. It has a very far reaching impact on your fee and interest income. Despite the runup, we are positive on it and that is something we have bought. We have also bought some of the fast moving electrical goods something like Havells and Bajaj Electricals. 


You touched upon consumption. I know that you have outlined some of the reasons why you are a little bearish on an M&M. If we bring in Maruti into the wider auto basket, how much more pain do you anticipate there and why?
My personal view is that a lot of the pain is in the price. Obviously, there has been news of production cuts but this was coming. The dealer inventories were going up from one month to two months despite large discounts. We have to watch out for two things; a) the facelift they have done for Baleno -- the response seems to be mixed. b) The Wagon R new model also has mixed reaction. The only model where the facelift seems to have worked is Ertiga. Also their Nexa platform has been incurring losses.

Various reports suggest the losses per store could be between Rs 80 lakhs to 1 crore but it is a transient phase for auto as a pack and during times when there is maximum pessimism long term, investors must look at it a little more dispassionately and with a three to five-year view. 

One can start accumulating Maruti on dips because there are also bigger factors like BS VI, tighter credit and some of the new electric vehicle models are supposed to be launched. All of this is likely to mean revert in some time. With a slightly long outlook, you can maybe add on dips. For now, in auto probably two-wheelers is a better bet."
11,2019-03-19,Nestle,"MUMBAI: Star India is set to rake in over Rs 2,100 crore in advertising revenues from 12th edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL), a sharp 20% jump over the previous season, when it had netted Rs 1,750 crore across TV and digital platforms.

“It’s been a really strong year and the response from the advertisers has overshot our earlier projections. This is testimony to the value IPL delivered last year and the plans we have this season,” said a highly placed source, adding that over 80% inventory has already been sold. IPL 2019 will kick off on March 23.

“I think Star has done fabulously well this season. Till last week, Rs 2,100 crore had been logged. The strategy to go language intensive has really helped. Also, a March IPL means residual budgets of last year are coming in handy and new fiscal budgets kicking in April,” said Dr. Sandeep Goyal, chairman, Mogae Media.

Some of the big advertisers who have come on board across TV and Hotstar this season include Coca-Cola, PhonePe, Vivo, Oppo, Swiggy, Maruti Suzuki, Dream 11, MRF, MakeMyTrip, Voltas, Asian Paints, Samsung LED, Future Group, Byju’s, Vimal Pan Masala, Mondelez, Mobile Premier League and Polycab.

Advertisers which have taken only digital sponsorship on Hotstar, include Amazon Pay, Flipkart, Madhura Garments and Nestle Maggi. Shashi Sinha, CEO at IPG Mediabrands, said the overall ad spends on IPL this season is “far better” than the previous season.



In an earlier interaction, Gautam Thakar, CEO, Star Sports, had told ET that IPL is by far India’s biggest property across genres and the company is excited to take it to the next level.

“We are better equipped this year with what can be done to make it the biggest IPL ever,” he had said.

IPL has been the only property that has delivered viewership growth year-on-year, over the last 11 years.

Star India had aired the league across six languages and 12 channels last year. This year, the network will show IPL across 22 channels. The Sunday matches will be aired on Star Gold (Hindi), Vijay Super (Tamil), Maa Movies (Telugu), Star Suvarna (Kannada), Jalsha Movies (Bengali), Star Pravah (Marathi) and Asianet Plus (Malayalam). Regional sports channels in Tamil, Kannada, Telugu, and Bengali (to be launched ahead of IPL) will carry matches on all days.

Star had incurred a loss of over Rs 1,200 crore from the 11th edition of the annual cricket extravaganza as per ET estimates. Star India had done bundled deals — selling both TV and digital together — for Rs 10 lakh per 10 seconds ad spot. While it met with resistance, the company managed to recover about Rs 1,750 crore, a 30% jump over previous year."

14,2019-03-27,Nestle,"MUMBAI: Patanjali Ayurved disrupted the Indian fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector with nature-based products in various categories to challenge the dominance of companies such as Hindustan Unilever (HUL) in the past three-four years. 

That has forced rivals, especially the multinationals, to retool their portfolios to introduce matching products at similar price points to try and regain their market ranking, analysts said. This seems to be paying off, they said.

The homegrown upstart has been most successful in staples such as ghee, flour, ayurvedic health supplements, toothpaste, edible oil and condiments but less so in noodles, biscuits, personal care, chocolates and juices.

Its rapid growth posed a threat to mainstream FMCG companies by renewing the natural/herbal/ayurvedic theme and compelling FMCG companies to tweak their range. For instance, HUL’s personal care products faced headwinds, prompting the company to relaunch its Ayush brand and acquire ayurvedic hair oil brand Indulekha. Having sustained similar damage in the oral care segment, Colgate-Palmolive launched its own herbal toothpaste.




The Patanjali effect on Colgate-Palmolive is waning, possibly due to distribution and supply chain issues apart from the fading novelty of its products, according to JPMorgan’s report this month on the FMCG sector by Latika Chopra and Sushruta Mishra.

While hurting FMCG companies in the short term, Patanjali predominantly gained market share in commoditised categories made up of unorganised players.


‘COMPANY CAN TROUBLE UNORGANISED PLAYERS’
Competitive intensity has faded in the organised end since Patanjali’s products no longer have the unique selling proposition (USP) of being natural with other brands having entered the market at similar or lower price points, experts said.

“The threat has receded but it is more of a case of Patanjali having lost the plot,” said Milind Sarwate, former CFO of Marico and now an independent director on several boards. “They tried too many things. They have not looked at their growing in scale at the back end. They succeeded in demand creation but not in demand fulfilment. They fell short of the institutional strength to sustain the rising volume. Their threat is definitely lower because they had internal issues — supply not being on time, trade not happy with them.”

Patanjali is diversifying into new categories such as garments and education. It’s also in the fray to acquire Ruchi Soya, a large player in the commoditised industry of solvent extraction or edible oils.

Analysts say that the company is likely to pose more of a threat to the unorganised sector going forward.

“Even if Patanjali is able to overcome its recent issues on quality and supply chain, we expect it to gain market share in these commoditised categories at the expense of unorganised players, and not pose a major threat to the listed F&B companies playing in non-commoditised categories,” said the food and beverage report released by Systematix Investments earlier this month. Still, Patanjali retains the ability to create further disruption, said Sarwate.

“Patanjali cannot be ignored by the market leaders — they are capable of a surprise,” he said. “I expect them to do something dramatic like giving 30% discount on their products or so.”

The JPMorgan report says there is a downside risk for Dabur’s growth prospects due to the overlap of categories with Patanjali such as chyawanprash, honey, hair oil and toothpaste.

Based on ETIG data, Nestle and Britannia have outperformed on the ground as well as on the bourses, despite competition from Patanjali. Dabur also has managed to keep improving its performance amid competitive intensity.

HUL’s market share in soaps has been resilient even after the entry of Patanjali, according to the latest report by Reliance Securities."
0,2019-04-01,Nestle,"The much vaunted consumption engine driving India’s economic growth is showing signs of wear and tear. After years of healthy growth, weak consumption metrics across sectors indicate a slowdown. 

Is this a temporary blip or is the consumption theme losing steam? Should investors recalibrate exposure to consumer stocks?


Not firing on all cylinders
Initial signs of fatigue have been visible in the automobile sector for the past few months. Starting from a lacklustre festival season in October last year, volumes have been tepid across segments. Sales in February dropped 8% from a year ago. This resulted in a pile up of inventory, forcing vehicle makers to cut down on production. Passenger vehicle inventory has grown to around 50-60 days, against the norm of 25-30 days. Even Maruti Suzuki, the largest passenger vehicle maker, has not been immune to the slowing demand. Reports say it has cut its monthly output by 20% to clear the backlog.

Two-wheeler makers are also feeling the heat, with sales falling 7.97% in February. Premium motorcycle manufacturer Royal Enfield saw a massive 14.3% drop in domestic sales compared to figures a year ago. Inventory levels in two-wheelers now stand at around 80-90 days compared to 20-25 days earlier. Hero MotoCorp, Honda and Eicher Motors have also cut production in response to the rising stockpile. Higher cost of vehicle ownership is one of the factors holding back consumers. Higher insurance outgo due to mandatory upfront payment of premium for a five-year policy has led to a sharp jump in the on-road purchase price of two-wheelers.

Apart from automobiles, other consumer durable makers are also witnessing a pullback in demand. Delayed onset of summer has impacted sales of cooling appliances such as refrigerators and air-conditioners. This has prompted several appliance makers to slash prices by up to 20%, according to a report by DBS-Emkay.


Passenger vehicle sales are slowing

Auto manufacturers are cutting production to clear inventory

February saw a steep decline in auto volumes

Higher cost of ownership is one of the factors holding back consumers.


Consumer staples firms have so far reported healthy volumes, but this too may moderate in the near future. While Hindustan Unilever, Marico and Dabur have posted strong volume growth in recent quarters, this is attributed to a favourable base effect—volumes had dropped sharply after introduction of GST a year ago. A CLSA report suggests that the growth rate for consumer staples firms should moderate to high single digits from double digits in the last five quarters. “This is visible in rural as well as urban markets. In fact rural, which was growing at over 1.3 times of urban, has seen a contraction in multiplier due to a weak macro environment including moderation in GDP growth and wage inflation,” the CLSA report points out.


What should investors do?
Does this signal a pull-back in India’s consumption story? Not quite, say analysts. There is a sense that consumers are postponing big-ticket consumption till after the elections. The tepid growth in durables can also largely be attributed to the liquidity crisis in NBFCs. These lenders have been unable to advance loans at the same pace or at earlier interest rates due to higher funding costs. 

Ambareesh Baliga, an independent market analyst, says, “The liquidity crunch in NBFCs may have precipitated this demand slowdown as many have had to cut back lending activity sharply.” Once these shadow banks resume lending, discretionary consumption will revert to the earlier trajectory. Although surprised at the demand slump, Vikas Gupta, CEO and Chief Investment Strategist, OmniScience Capital, rules out any secular decline in the consumption story. He insists that the current weakness suggests a lot of pent-up demand is likely to translate into sales in the coming months. “Sales not coming through now will definitely show up in the coming quarters, which will give a bump to revenues,” Gupta points out.

The consumption theme is likely to remain a dominant play in coming years. However, investors may feel the pinch in the near term. Analysts expect the weakness in automobile volumes to persist till the elections. “The 2019-20 fiscal could be a challenging year for the sector due to transition to BS-6 norms,” says a Kotak Securities note. 

Motilal Oswal Securities prefers passenger vehicles over two-wheelers or commercial vehicles as it is the least impacted segment currently. Maruti Suzuki is its preferred pick. “We estimate Maruti Suzuki will gain more market share led by strong product lifecycle,” says the report. Its alliance with Toyota addresses the company’s long-term sustainability issues by getting access to electric vehicles and hybrid technologies of Toyota.

Kotak Securities expects two-wheeler industry volumes to be subdued over the next two years. This is due to increase in vehicle prices post increase in insurance costs and a weaker consumer sentiment. In this segment, analysts are positive on Bajaj Auto which benefits from 40% exposure to export markets. Bajaj Auto was the only two-wheeler maker to clock healthy volume growth of 10% in February. Baliga expects demand for low-value items to pick up before elections and hence prefers consumer staples over discretionary. HUL, Nestle and Dabur are among his preferred picks for their reach and distribution."
1,2019-04-03,Nestle,"Your portfolio might be different than what the market is liking because this upsurge is led by the FII 
  
  
  
  buying, Raamdeo Agrawal, MD & Co-Founder, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, said in an interview with Nikunj Dalmia of ETNOW. Edited excerpts:

There is a missed-out feeling about the March rally. It is the FIIs who are better off.
It is party without invitation, I say. We are not invited to the party. So yes, there is a bit of missed-out kind of situation there. Your portfolio might be different than what the market is liking because this time this upsurge is led by the FII buying. FIIs predominately are buying through ETFs. There is an active element also but a lot of it is ETF. 

So, the entire basket of buying is very different from what we were used to for the last four-five years. Hence, the portfolio alignment with the FII kind of buying is not exactly true for everybody. At least in my case, we have participated but not as much as I would have wished. We are still about 5% below all-time high so that does not connect. If it is all-time high today, I wish I am 5% ahead of the index. But right now, I am 5% behind.


You are talking about your fund NAV just for the benefit of our viewers.
Yes AMC basically.


Are you making the case that it is only the magic or brute force of liquidity which has made all the difference and the ground reality has not changed? Should we still be nervous about election, about where interest rate and liquidity are headed?
Yes but that goes on. There is always something happening. If there is no election, then something else will be happening. In October-November, we were struggling with three states elections. Now the big one is ahead of us. FIIs are coming back and global economy again is reviving. There is a complete collapse of the interest rate cycle and interest yields all over the world and hence the dollar is weak. 

A lot of these short-term things keep happening and we have to grapple with everything but finally, we are in the investing game. Investing is much longer term. You have to cross over all these day-to-day activities and the excitement is that through the 365 days, through the five years, ten years, these things will keep happening -- sometimes very good, sometimes not so good. But the entrepreneur has to straddle through all this and make money for the shareholders.

We have to see which are those companies that are relentlessly making money and hence we buy some of those companies in our portfolio. Investing is a lot less active, more lazy kind of business. It takes time to figure out what is going to happen in this election. If it is 300 plus, then I will act like this. If it is 250, then like this. At 200, like this. No this is not like that. My sense is that yes it is a big event. There will be a lot of volatility and we have to watch it very closely but it does not really make me move that much.


Irrespective of whether the government has been market friendly or non-market friendly, 8 out of 10 times markets have gone higher in the election. If the back data is so strong and supportive, why do people get nervous every time?
Every time, it is a different story. This time, one of the reasons was that market had risen for first four years big time. From 2014 to 2017, it was one way up on the hope of earnings recovery. But earnings recovery did not come. The markets went up, the PE multiple expanded but the earnings did not follow and ultimately the stocks collapsed so midcap and smallcaps collapsed. The moment the flow stopped or slowed down, there was a kind of fear will this collapse continue. So, they said the next big event is this election, let’s get that over and then we will reconsider whether to come or not.

Meanwhile while they were reconsidering, FIIs came in, kind of pumped history’s one of the largest monthly input, Rs 32,000-33,000 crore. In investing this, trying to figure out what the market will do, you will go grey, lose your hair and gain nothing because that is why market is such an interesting and fantastic place! You cannot actually figure out. All the millions of guys are trying to figure out what is going to happen next one day, one week, one month, but I do not think we can do it.


I am going to this quote from one of the books of compilation and that quote is very simple. “Predicting the market is trying to understand the nature of a woman, highly unpredictable”. That is what markets have taught us in February. The FIIs came in with Rs 32,000 crore.
They took all the risk of pre-election uncertainties that were there.


There are perhaps three scenarios we think of; a), return of current administration; b) Return of current administration with an outside support; or c) change of guard. What scenario is the markets pricing in currently?
My sense is that the market is pricing in a return of this regime and that too led by Mr Modi, but with reduced majority. From 282, BJP alone will be somewhat lower seems to be what the market has priced in. 

The unofficial betting market is talking about 245 to 250 for BJP. I do not have any more intelligence than that. I was there in one of the conferences, where about 500 IFAs were there. I do not think anybody believed that this government may not come. So the second alternative.

I do not think that there is any adequate understanding of what happens if by chance, this government does not come. The market is completely sitting on the belief that this government is coming for sure.


If markets fall like they did in May 2004 when markets were not very happy with the election verdict, you were a buyer that time. You were in Kashmir and I remember you called up your dealers and said bhai lelo sale laga hua hai (Buy up. There’s a sale on). If the markets fall now, will you be a buyer?
Yes, to the extent we have the liquidity because unfortunately my investment style is such that we do not leave too much of liquidity on the table and flow is in any case very weak. Net flow is literally zero. We are sitting with 1%, 2% of the total corpus and that looks to be on the high side. It is not that we are sitting on cash. 

What happens in a collapse in case of a sudden collapse in the market is that you get a disequilibrium between two prices. Say HDFC Bank will go down by 2% but something else will fall 15%. At that time, you have a chance to swap some portion of this with that. If you can get some interesting trade, of course, we are sitting there for that, that is the active manager’s job.


Why has everybody repeatedly told us in the last three years that Nestle, Page, Bajaj Finance, these are good companies, great franchise but PE multiples are not the multiples at which where you will make money. Is that true for somebody who has a 10-year timeframe?
Yes and no. Your return requirement is very important. If you want to make 12-13%, these are wonderful companies because they are fully priced and there is no surprise. You are not bringing anything on the table. When you go to buy Page, Nestle or Lever, there is nothing which the market does not know. So the price is fully for quality, growth and longevity -- absolutely priced to perfection. 

So if you want to make a 12-13% return portfolio these companies are fantastic.


Do you think the portfolio which you currently have has earning potential of 20% plus?
Yes, that is the whole idea. I mean right now what has happened is, yesterday only I was seeing some data, there are very few companies which have grown more than 20% in the last three years compounded. 

Above Rs 10,000 crore m-cap in 2015 and with earnings growth of more than 20%, there would be only 45 companies. How do you build an entire portfolio within that 45, which have grown faster than 20% -- like 40-50%. If you have more companies, if the recovery in the economy is much more broad-based, then your portfolio has a much better chance of getting say 20% growth or 25% growth. But if there are only five companies which are growing at more than 25%, you cannot have all five in your portfolio. I love the number 25 but to get across 20-25 companies and probably a larger amount of money, it is very tough. 


You have always remained fully invested. Is this a good strategy? Do you think this works?
It has worked for me. It saves me from this daily headache. If you do not have money, what is the point in asking the price of everything? We keep working around the companies we have or till the new ideas to find. We have the conferences, we keep meeting the company managements but even if you have say 10% cash and 90% in stock market, what is your wish to the God? Would you pray that the market should go down or should it go up? If you pray to the God that market should go down, with 90% money in market, what will your main allocation? We must look at our allocation. 

If I have 5% cash, the rest is in stock. You are in the bull side and it is better the market does well, so that bulk of the money is doing well. Investment management is a very individualistic effort. 


On the budget day, you were not very bullish.
Yes, not bullish. But I was 100% invested. So my portfolio strategy is very clear. I will remain 100% invested."

3,2019-04-05,Nestle,"2018 was a very strong year for most corporates and I think 2019 also is panning out reasonably well, said Suresh 
   
   
   Narayanan, MD, Nestle India, in an interview with ETNOW.Edited excerpts:

How do you think the consumption sector is going to do this year? 
The overall consumption story in the country would by and large remain unchanged. We can have these little ups and downs but overall the consumption story in India has been a fairly strong. 2018 was a very strong year for most corporates and I think 2019 also is panning out reasonably well. 

Obviously a rate cut would lead to hopefully better credit in the market because one of the issues that has been talked about quite often has been the paucity of funds available within the market. Hopefully that should improve. Elections are always augur well for overall consumption. One does hope that in the last lap before the vote is being cast, there would be some uptick in consumption as well. With the overall position on the monsoons being fairly satisfactory, we can look forward to the sustainability of this consumption story.


Were you not disheartened by Skymet’s first forecast that monsoon could be below normal this year or are you waiting for the IMD?
Let us watch and wait. I think it is early days. We have seen reversals of predictions before and I do not think at this stage we should get disheartened about it but the fact of the matter is, if indeed we have had a decent monsoon in the past years, the overall consumption story would remain intact.

I do not think that economic growth follows linear models of equality all the time or it increases secularly all the time. We can have our ups and downs, but so long as the fundamental fabric of consumption in the economy remains intact, we should be alright."
4,2019-04-16,Nestle,"NEW DELHI: Nifty futures on the Singapore Exchange were trading 13 points, or 0.11 per cent, higher at 11,750, indicating a positive start for the Nifty50. Here are a few stocks which may buzz the most in today’s trade:

Board meetings



Analyst calls
• Anand Rathi has retained buy rating on AIA Engineering with a target price of ₹2,218. Customers added in the gold, copper and platinum sectors should lead to healthy volume growth for AIA Engineering, said Anand Rathi. The higher entry barrier and deeper penetration are likely to keep good volume growth at least for the next five years, the brokerage added. 

• Edelweiss has maintained reduce rating on Adani Power with a target price of ₹33 after the CERC approved the supplementary PPA for 2,000 MW capacity between GUVNL and Adani Power’s Mundra plant. CERC’s order comes as a big relief for the beleaguered Mundra plant and raises hopes of a successful resolution of the PPA with Haryana discom as well, said Edelweiss. 

• Investec Securities has maintained buy rating on Kotak Mahindra Bank with a target price of ₹1,560 after the lender decided to reduce interest rates in the less than ₹0.1 million ticket savings deposits This comes as a surprise given that liquidity remains tight, deposits growth continues to lag advances growth and more importantly SA deposits are moving towards higher yielding term deposits, said Investec. 

• UBS has maintained buy rating on Axis Bank and raised target price to ₹1,010 from ₹780. The brokerage expects Axis' growth and profit differential with HDFC Bank to narrow over FY19-22, driven mainly by Axis' favourable loan mix change, gains from its physical/digital network and lower credit costs. 

• Edelweiss has initiated coverage on Amber Enterprises India with a target price of ₹1,050. Amber Enterprisesis the largest contract manufacturer of residential air conditioners in India, with 55% market share, said Edelweiss.

Edelweiss Alternative Research"
5,2019-04-16,Nestle,"Whenever you see new kid on the IPO block, there will be positive excitement around it because merchant 
  
  
  bankers would also have their bit to do in terms of pushing it, said Hemang Jani, Senior Vice President, Sharekhan, in an interview with ETNOW. Edited excerpts: 

History is telling us not to worry about elections and move on, but street beleieves we will take a view only post the election verdict. Why is that?
What is playing in the minds of investors is the fact that for almost about 15 months or so, there has not been any meaningful appreciation in the portfolios, if you leave aside the top four to five index heavyweights. The performance of the broader market has not been that great. When for an extended period of 12 to 15 months, the portfolio gains are mediocre, that definitely weighs on decision making. 

Given the fact that even the earnings growth has not been that great and you have a major event coming up, that probably would put people into some kind of a tight spot. But if you look at the overall retail activity, particularly in March, mutual fund inflows have definitely improved. So, I agree that the participation has not been that great but given the fact that March has been a much better month and you have an event like election which would bring in a lot of volatility, retail participation from here on can increase. 


There are no signs of a breakthrough when it comes to the saga at Jet Airways. Now it seems like the talks have really drawn a blank. There is going to be another crucial board meeting that will extend today. What is the worst case scenario you can think for Jet Airways in light of this?
It is a sad episode for the Indian airline industry that one of the best performing airlines is going through this kind of a period. The fact that it is taking more time to get the funds and to bring in a new investor, is not boding well for the company because international operations have been halted and if they are not able to get the intervening relief, then there will be question marks on domestic operations also.

It is not a great news for the sector per se and let us hope that over the next few days they are able to at least get some fund infusion. If a very strong investor comes in, then the stock can start stabilising from here on.


The entire Nestle India royalty is not as bizarre a case like Jubilant Foodworks and a royalty here is only justifiable, but would it go down well with minority shareholders if the quantum is a little too high?
This royalty issue has always been there for many of the MNC companies and whenever there is some increase or a new proposal, there is going to be a lot of media hype around it and there can be a bit of a negative knee-jerk reaction. But the companies are very strong and they enjoy a brand and product franchise. I do not think the market is going to be too much worried about it and in case of Nestle, last year has been good. They have been able to win the market share. The entire controversy around Maggi has died down. and the company has started really doing pretty well on the volumes front. I do not think we should read too much negatively into this royalty issue at this point of time.


Suddenly there is a lot of interest in the insurance space. Is this a pure rotation, a migration of flows not by choice but by compulsion?
It is possible that some part of the money which is meant for investments in the financial services space could move into the insurance space. For the last couple of months, we have seen major deals happening over there. In ICICI Pru, we could see a big investor coming in and from there the stock has recovered. 

The larger issue for the insurance company has been that a company like Prudential ICICI which has a larger dependence on the ULIP related products. There is a sense that dependence will go down and overall in the pure term plan segment per se, the companies are delivering a very healthy growth. A combination of this new money coming in and the fact that with the ULIP related issues have actually played out, people are becoming a little more positive and partly also because some of the companies could be included in some of the indices where the rebalancing is happening will also bring in an element of new flows. 

A combination of these factors are playing out and we continue to be positive on that sector. Our preferred stock is definitely Bajaj Finserv which has general insurance as well as life insurance and is quoting at a discount of about 12% to 15% to HDFC Life and ICICI Pru.


It is good to see that the IPO market is thriving again. The subscription numbers were absolutely amazing. What is so unique about Polycab India? Why is there was so much interest in a business which is more a B2B and less a B2C business?
The product range and the business model of Polycab is pretty similar to some of the names like Havells or V-Guard or KI Industries, Crompton etc. with consumer products a decent amount of volume growth of about 12 to 15%. 

Polycab could be one of the companies that will fit into that particular segment. They have a very decent market share and they are also moving into those newer categories where growth could be in excess of about 12-15%. The market at this point of time likes to move into these kind of niche companies with a decent amount of brand volume growth in excess of 10%. We have not had any major IPO pipeline because of the weak sentiment in the broader market. Whenever you see new kid on the block, there will be positive excitement around it because merchant bankers would also have their bit to do in terms of pushing it. It could be a decent company from investor perspective.


Who is buying Tata Motors?
If you look at the last monthly numbers particularly from the markets like US, UK and some of the other markets, the data has shown a marked improvement. Also, after the S&P downgrades, the management came out and gave a positive guidance in terms of their overall growth and the sense one is getting is that after such a huge underperformance, finally the stock has started catching up on the domestic market because of the product rollouts that they have had, met with some amount of success. 

I think some people might be taking a call that the worst is over in terms of operational performance and price performance and risk rewards looks better but it has been the most difficult stock to track in terms of what is really happening. We have always had a neutral stance on the stock for quite some time and we continue to remain that way.


What is your view on Dr Reddy’s? Their Bachupally unit, which accounts for 45% of the US revenues, has got an EIR by the USFDA. Would you be willing to buy DRL just yet?
Yes, this development is quite positive because the lifting of the warning letter or this EIR that they have got for Bachupally is definitely important. What is more important is that within a very short timeframe, they could actually bring in this particular EIR and overall, most of the pharma companies the US business is stabilising and on a quarter-on-quarter basis, there has been a decent amount of growth with margin and outlook continuing to be good. 

Some of these stocks present a good investment opportunity and we expect even DRL to do well from a 12-month perspective at current price point."
6,2019-04-18,Nestle,"If you are going to play India for the next two, three years on consumption and political stability, then banking is 
  
  
  where you put your money in, either a strong ETF like Bank BeES or some of the select mutual funds will be proxy to that, said Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive Vice President, IIFL Securities, in an interview with ETNOW. Edited excerpts: 


What do you do if you miss the bus on the RIL behemoth?
That is a million dollar question. Do I chase at Rs 1,380 or not? However, the underpinnings will now get into outperformance given the Saudi Aramco interest which again puts in the valuation of the energy business at a premium. Reliance is no longer an energy giant. It is migrating towards being a technology company and that is the way forward. Reliance looks at a 100 crore people and they focus there, That is what the whole game plan has been. There has been this slow transition from energy into technology. The Jio numbers, the ARPUs, naphtha, shale gas, petchem, all these will be some of parts but any underperformance will be allayed because of the Saudi Aramco buyback. I had a target of Rs 1,500 by year-end. That can be revised closer to Rs 1,700 now given the fresh developments and given the outperformance it will continue to have on Nifty.


Not only are you bullish on the overall market trajectory but you are expecting earnings to really surprise this quarter. In which pockets of the market would we see that strength with regards to earnings as well?
 I was one of the few to put my neck out and say that we are hitting 12,000 in April and now, we are at the cusp of 12,000. I still think 12,000 to 12,200 before the elections is very much on. The pessimists will continue to doubt the rally. You are in the midst of a global upsurge. India is an outperformer on the back of the rupee, bond yields and earnings upgrades which we think will gather momentum once we are through with the election. 

So yes, construction, consumption, automobile, metals will see base effect where laggards will become leaders. For PSUs as a pack, the valuations have been extremely lucrative in the last two months. A large part of that has got corrected but we still think that earnings upgrade will be in cycle. So capex from the private and the PSU side will add up and consumption spending is there to stay. A 20% upside on the earnings from this quarter onwards will be on the cards, which will see re-rating of the market.


At least for DRL, most things are now clearing out. Would it be on your buy radar at all?
As a disclosure, we may have been contrarian on pharma but DRL has been one of our top picks at Rs 2,250. Rs 3,200 was my target in the near term. I think that may be revised on the upside given that we think this quarter, there should be a strong impetus on the numbers. A large part of their contract facilities have got the clearance and like you pointed out, this new development will again be catapulted, given that the CIS nations growth on the rupee front will also be added beneficiary. 

If you want to be contrarian, then book profit in IT. IT is fully priced and if you want to play any rupee weakness, then pharma would be the way. Lupin, Dr Reddy, Sun, Aurobindo and Divi’s Lab is where you could see outperformance. A relative midcap on pharma fund would be an idle mix for the next two years with the 28% upside coming in the next earnings calendar at least.


In the run up to the election, the FPIs have loaded up on banks as well. Where within the banking space are you finding value?
We had given a target of 32,000 when the Bank Nifty was 27,000 for a year-end target. We may have to revise it on the upside because banks are proxy to credit growth. We have seen credit growth at 16% versus deposits at 12% and that tells us that once liquidity gets sorted, then the people with the liquidity will be large beneficiaries. That is the liability franchise. 

Corporate banks, given the write-backs and the asset quality improvements will outperform. Select PSU banks will come out with write-backs. The numbers will be way ahead of estimates. But if I could name three banks, it would be Axis, ICICI and SBI in the largecaps in that order. But our real plays are the midcap banks. IDFC Bank has been my dark horse play. I do not rule out that stock doubling in the next two years, given the franchise of MSME and retail all under one roof with Mr Vaidyanathan heading it. 

The other two would be DCB and Federal Bank. But if you are going to play India for the next two, three years on consumption and political stability, then banking is where you put your money in, either a strong ETF like Bank BeES or some of the select mutual funds will be proxy to that. 


There are a lot of mixed reports on consumption. Why do you feel consumption may be an interesting space right now?
We know that auto sales have been disappointing and that has been there for last two quarters but that is a hiatus effect. This has to do with the insurance norms, the BS IV norms and a whole host of change of regulatory concerns because of the IL&FS fiasco. But all that is broadening out. Come the second half and you should start to see strong sales on before the implementation of some of the construction changes. 

Ashok Leyland is now looking at CIS countries, and that could have a huge effect. Autos has been a huge wealth creator. We view this decline as an opportunity to buy. We think consumers are going to be back on track and that will spur demand for this discretionary side.

 We also think consumption in the durable side, given the strong onset of a hot summer, will set the cat amongst the pigeons. The likes of Voltas, Havells, BlueStar will be huge beneficiaries.

Thirdly, the other is the consumer staple side, where valuations have corrected. One of our top picks ITC is just on the verge of a breakout. We think there has been a huge consolidation ITC and that could be a relative outperformer. Nestle as a discretionary play will see huge outperformance given its new product launches which are going to hit the summer scene on the coffee side and some of parts some of their new other products which will again start to gain market share. So I think if you want to be in this market these stocks are relatively expensive but you want to stay with the leaders."
7,2019-04-23,Nestle,"When it comes to investing in Indian stocks, consumption is a theme one can ill-afford to ignore.

While rising incomes and an ever-growing younger population make consumption a sure-shot bet, newer trends in the market are throwing up definitive cues on where money is waiting to be made.

Indian policymakers’ increased focus on financially empowering the poor, and rapid spread of mobile and internet are working as an icing on the cake for investors looking to cash in on India’s consumption boom.

India Inc is taking note.

Billionaire businessman Mukesh Ambani last month acquired ITC’s mid-segment menswear brand John Players to strengthen Reliance Retail’s readymade garments and accessories portfolio in the fashion and lifestyle retail space.

In another development, Aditya Birla-led Grasim Industries acquired Soktas India for Rs 135.12 crore. Soktas India is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Soktas Tekstil Sanayi ve Ticaret AS, a world-renowned producer and marketer of premium shirting fabrics with its main facilities at Soke in Turkey.

The growth potential of India’s consumption sector can also be gauged from the fact that India emerged as the only big market to clock FMCG growth of 13.8 per cent in 2018 while global growth stood at 2-2.50 per cent, according to AC Nielson.

That high base may result in a slowdown in consumption this year, but it still remains a solid bet for faster growth.

“This sector is in a long-term bull market,” says Atul Suri, CEO, Marathon Trends PMS. “I have been overweight on consumption on a longer timeframe,” he told ETNow in an interview.

Divergent trends have emerged in this space of late; some stocks are faltering while others are touching lifetime highs. 

“There are divergent trends emerging across the sector. We like to identify stocks and watch their behaviour in a falling market, because stocks that go up or hold up well in a falling market usually emerge as leaders in the next bull market,” Suri said.

Analysts say lifestyle changes among individuals, especially millennials, is the hottest theme, as this is what is increasingly driving India’s consumption story.

There are expectations that India will become the largest country globally in terms of population size at 1.60 billion by 2030. It currently has around 1.05 billion citizens in the age group of 15-60 against China’s 0.98 billion.

Going with market experts, FMCG, e-commerce, smartphone manufacturers, auto, telecom, education, and services are some of the industries that are likely to benefit, given the spending behaviour of these consumers. 

In the offline space, the salience of food products is increasing in every retail outlet as witnessed in rising throughput per store, says Elara Capital.

The brokerage believes the food space is expected to perform better than home and personal care (HPC) products in calendar 2019. 

Elara recommends Britannia with a price target of Rs 3,478 and Nestle with a target price of Rs 11,716 as these companies have been growing direct reach every year.

In the online space, health (juices), organic, babycare products (diapers, skincare and wipes), ready-to-eat and ready-to-cook products and children & school-oriented foods were among the fastest-growing categories in Calendar 2018. 
At present, eCommerce contributes around 2 per cent of total FMCG sales in India. With the rise of smartphone us, the figure is likely to multiply in the days ahead.

India is projected to have around 1,200 million smartphone users by 2030 against 300 million in 2016. It may touch 440 million by the end of next year, according to a research done by AC Nielsen and Elara Securities.

Select companies are already doing profitable business riding the eCommerce boom.

Bata India’s Ram Kumar Gupta says its eCommerce business is quite profitable and the contribution from the medium is almost 6 per cent. 

Brokerage Nirmal Bang Securities has an ‘accumulate’ rating on Bata India with a target price of Rs 1,479.

Organised players engaged in production and distribution of health food drinks as well as milk and milk products are the others to watch.

India’s per capita milk consumption stood at 110 gm until 1970s and was declining. It now stands at 370-380 gm and is expected to reach 800-850 gm a day (equivalent to that of Europe and the US today) by 2030. In the dairy space, Elara is bullish on Heritage Foods and Parag Milk Foods with price targets of Rs 825 and Rs 366, respectively.

Despite a 12.50 per cent rally, the BSE FMCG index underperformed Sensex (up 15 per cent) in FY19. Stocks like Balrampur Chini Mills, Dalmia Bharat, United Breweries, Godfrey Phillips, Dabur, Nestle, HUL and Britannia Industries advanced 25-77 per cent during the financial year, while Kwality, Manpasand Beverages, LT Foods and Ruchi Soya tanked over 50 per cent."
8,2019-04-24,Nestle,"MUMBAI | NEW DELHI: The Directorate General of Anti-profiteering has charged Procter & Gamble India with profiteering from cut in goods and services tax to the extent of about Rs 250 crore by not passing on the benefits to consumers.

“The investigation covered the entire range of products sold by the company and found anti-profiteering of about Rs 250 crore,” a DGAP official said.

DGAP has submitted its report on the matter to National Anti-profiteering Authority, which will now hear the case and pass an order, the official said.

The maker of Tide detergent and Pantene shampoo could face a penalty if the authority confirms the DGAP report. If found guilty, NAA can also direct P&G to reduce prices, and refund benefit availed to consumers.




The Indian unit of the world's biggest consumer goods firm controls more than half the market for sanitary napkins, diapers and shaving razors, a quarter in shampoo segment and about a fifth of India's laundry category.

A P&G spokesperson said it has always been committed to passing the net benefit of GST rate reduction to the consumers.

“We have passed the net benefit and communicated the same via advertising in mass media to help increase awareness with the consumers, shoppers and retailers,” the spokesperson said.

“We will continue to cooperate with the authorities in this matter and provide clarifications. We hope that the concerned authorities will appreciate the procedure followed to pass on the GST benefit and will take a just view of the matter.”

In January, NAA had held the country’s top consumer products firm Hindustan Unilever (HUL) guilty of profiteering Rs 462 crore by not passing on GST benefits to consumers, which the company challenged in court. The Delhi High Court has stayed the demand until the final determination of the matter in the court.

NAA has also held Jubilant Food-Works and Patanjali guilty for not passing on GST-cut benefit of Rs 41 crore and Rs 150 crore each.

Last year, a DGAP probe had found that Nestle India had profiteered about Rs 100 crore by not passing on GST benefit. Since the rollout of GST in July 2017, most companies, including HUL and P&G, have said they have passed on the benefit of lower taxes by lowering prices or increasing the weight of items, something that NAA has not favoured yet.

Price reduction efforts gained pace in November 2017 when the GST Council cut tax rates on 200 products including chocolates, toothpaste, shampoo, washing powder and shaving creams, to 18% from 28%, to ease the burden on consumers. The government wanted to ensure that this intent is translated into action.

Since November, companies were allowed to “affix an additional sticker or stamping or online printing for declaring the reduced MRP (maximum retail price) on the pre-packaged commodity” in view of the revision in GST rates. The additional sticker had to be pasted alongside the earlier labelling — to show the difference in price — and was allowed until December. That was to allow for a transition period of about two-four weeks before packs with new price labels reach stores."

Analyst calls

 • Jefferies has maintained buy on NTPC and revised target price to ₹160 from ₹171. NTPC should see twin benefits of operational improvement and capacity addition in the next five years, said Jefferies. Potential earnings upside of 5-6% from demand-led PLF recovery is an additional benefit, it added.

 • ICICI Securities has initiated coverage on Bandhan Bank with a target price of ₹763. The opportunity that Bandhan has to leverage is its own strengths and fully exploit its banking licence can result in superior growth and profitability.

 • Kotak Institutional Equities has retained reduce rating on MRF and revised fair value lower to ₹52,000 from ₹56,000. The brokerage said its cautious view on the stock is underpinned by three major concerns: potential market share loss in the truck-bus radial tyre segment and higher-sized passenger vehicle tyres due to lack of product innovation and investment in R&D; normalisation of margins in the increasingly competitive two-wheeler segment; and expensive valuations. 

 • Morgan Stanley has maintained underweight rating on Tata Global Beverages with a target price of ₹165. Fourth quarter earnings growth was affected by one-off losses from associates, said Morgan Stanley. There is no quick fix,especially for Tata Global's international business,given the weak brand construct,exposure to a relatively unattractive category/geographic mix,and mediocre return ratios, it said. 

 • Investec Securities has initiated coverage on Orient Electric with a target price of ₹210. Following its demerger from Orient Paper in 2017, Orient Electric’s new management team has undertaken measures to improve rand positioning, product offering, distribution and logistics, said Investec.

10,2019-04-25,Nestle,"The local arm of Swiss packaged foods maker Nestle India said on Thursday that a resolution for continuity of royalty payments every five years has been approved with a majority at its 60th Annual General Meeting (AGM).

Nestle India chairman and managing director Suresh Narayanan said in a statement issued to the stock exchange: “The shareholders have shown faith in management’s ability to deliver long term shareholder value.""

Nestle, which presently pays 4.5% of its net sales as royalty towards its parent company, had sought shareholder approval for royalty payments every five years to its parent company.

Though the general licensing agreements are reviewed periodically by the audit committee, the resolution has been modified to provide for shareholder approval every five years, in accordance with laws and regulations, the maker of KitKat chocolate and Maggi instant noodles had said.

The company had increased its royalty payment from 3.5% of net sales in 2014 to 4.3% in 2018."

Analyst calls• Citigroup Global Markets has upgraded AU Small Finance Bank to buy from sell and raised target price to ₹720 from ₹535. Erosion in NIM due to yield compression has constrained ROA over the past four quarters despite realization of scale benefits in opex, said Citi. 

• IIFL has an add rating on Coromandel International with a target price of ₹ 440. Fertiliser MRPs are expected to fall ahead of the Kharif season, and this could potentially weigh on sales volumes and margins, said IIFL. 

• CLSA has downgraded Bharti Infratel to sell from outperform and lowered price target to ₹285 from ₹300, citing muted tenancy growth outlook. With Vodafone Idea looking to optimise its network operating costs and the continuing slowdown in new tenancies by Reliance Jio, the tenancy growth outlook for the company is likely to be muted in the near term, said CLSA.

0,2019-05-02,Nestle,"MUMBAI: Viacom18 has roped in Shaadi.com CEO Gourav Rakshit as head of its video-on- demand service Voot.

Rakshit will join as COO of Viacom18 Digital Ventures, a position that was vacated by Gaurav Gandhi last year, who joined Amazon Prime Video as country manager.

Rakshit will report to Sudhanshu Vats, Group CEO & MD, Viacom18. 

“Our digital foray has grown exponentially since its inception 3 years back, with the sharply segmented businesses – the ad led model, the international business and the soon-to-be-launched subscription based VOOT Kids service”, said Vats. “As we unlock business value, Gourav, with an in-depth understanding of digital disruption and a proven track-record of envisioning subscription growth, is the right person to lead our talented teams across the Digital Ventures portfolio.”

A University of Rochester and IIM Ahmedabad alumnus, Rakshit is currently serving as the President and CEO of People Group that owns and operates Shaadi.com. 

Over the course of 11 years at Shaadi.com, he has been instrumental in building a robust consumer subscription play, while delivering one of the few profitable P&Ls in the Indian internet ecosystem.

Rakshit comes with over 2 decades of experience in Consumer Technology, IT and FMCG sectors. He started his career with Nestle and took two more stops – Planetasia and Infosys Consulting - before joining People Group."
1,2019-05-03,Nestle,"In what will impact big listed companies like Maruti Suzuki, Colgate, GSK, HUL and Nestle, Market regulator Sebi is in favour of capping royalty payments at 2 per cent, as against Kotak Committees recommendation of 5 per cent. Sources tell ET Now that market regulator will bring up the issue with Finance Ministry post elections. 

“We are in favour of minority shareholders so it makes sense to have a cap on royalty payments at 2 per cent”, said an official in the know of the development. 

North Block is against keeping a cap on royalty payments as it is discourages multinational companies to invest in Technology transfer or invest in research and development. “We are in discussion with Finance ministry and assessing if differentiations should be made based on technology transfer or brands”, the source added. 

ET Now learns that the market regulator may be open to a higher than 2 per cent royalty in case of technology transfer. Some listed players also reached out to Sebi for a clarity on the royalty payment issue. 

“Most listed companies are paying royalty payments in excess of 2 per cent, a cap will significantly increase value for shareholders and we are in favour of that”, the source added. Royalty payments for Nestle stood at 4.36 per cent of total turnover in FY18, while royalty payments for India’s largest carmaker Maruti stood at 4.72 per cent as a percentage of its revenues for FY18. 

Other FMCG player HUL pays less than 2 per cent in addition to 1 per cent as fees for central service from parent Unilever Plc and Colgate's royalty payout as a percentage of net sales stood at 4.97 per cent for FY18."
2,2019-05-12,Nestle,"ET’s weekly roundup of the wackiest whispers and murmurs in corporate corridors and policy parlours:


Dinner & DebateAt a private dinner recently at the residence of Srei’s Hemant Kanoria in Kolkata’s tony Alipore neighbourhood, industrialistturned-BJP man Shishir Bajoria got into an animated discussion over the Barrackpore Lok Sabha seat, from where TMC’s Dinesh Trivedi is seeking a hat-trick. Challenging him is Arjun Singh, former TMC MLA and local strongman who is fighting on a BJP ticket. BJP is making this constituency a prestige issue, even though Trivedi’s popularity cuts across party lines.


Padding UpThe cricket World Cup is around the corner and two millionaire playboys are busy finalising their man caves for the summer in Belgravia, near St James Woods. A special brew is also going to be shipped from Bavaria to lift spirits and a chef will be flown in from Copenhagen. Considering Mayfair is already an Indian zip code, we wonder if these parties might upset the fancy desi neighbours, many of whom prefer to spend the English summer quietly, away from the din of India.


Jab We MetSo you thought Bollywood glam dolls Deepika Padukone and Priyanka Chopra and heiresses Isha Ambani Piramal and Natasha Poonawalla were the only Indians to sparkle on the Met gala red carpet? Millennial entrepreneur and jewellery designer Payal Shah’s $100,000 stretch bracelet for Nick Jonas also broke the internet. Hong Kong and Mumbai-hopping Shah has been a favourite for many global divas — from Lady Gaga to Nicki Minaj and Katy Perry among others but her latest unisex line has created a massive stir. Go girl.


A Different LeagueWith the top job in Asia-Pacific at a US bank up for grabs, this banker might soon be headed to Hong Kong for the biggest role in the region. His successor in India is settling down fast and the transition will soon be completed. A quintessential relationship man who still gets excited when he sees a deal, this might be the biggest move in his 40-plus years with the same franchise though his key clients would hate to let him go overseas.


Funding For The FutureA private equity/venture fund with commitment from the current group chairman and a few endowments – seems to be the plan ahead for Tata Trusts’ former chief trustee and RNT confidant R Venkataramanan, who stepped down from the largest corporate trust that controls the lion’s share of Tata Sons. Apart from steering the ambitious social programmes of the Trust in areas as diverse as cancer care, animal welfare, the girl child and skill development, Venkat, as he is popularly known, was also closely involved with RNT’s VC bets. So investing should come naturally for this lowprofile, former science graduate with a degree in law from Mumbai University.


Comfort FoodHe’s instrumental in getting the now cult Indian Accent to the Big Apple, yet Anand Mahindra decided to spend May Day at Saravana Bhavan in Manhattan to celebrate his 64th birthday with grand kids, daughters and family friends. Blues music, denims and fast cars are fine passions to have but a break from the high life with some comfort food of idlis and sambhar is the best way to stay rooted.


Vote PredictionsInformal betting on the election outcome is common across offices in the country. The predictions are typically based on gut instinct and some basic research on how the parties could perform. Some have taken that to a higher level. In a Bengaluru tech firm, individuals are giving to their boss, in a sealed cover, predictions using analytics based on online conversations across platforms. The covers will only be opened on May 23, the day of the results, to ensure that the excitement continues to the last day.


Trust HeadTata Trusts is still in the process of selecting a CEO to manage its trusts and charitable activities. We hear it’s willing to look outside the conglomerate for a suitable candidate. We learn that initially three were in contention from within, led by Rajendra Bhinge, a Tata veteran, and N Srinath, who served as an executive assistant to Ratan Tata and later was promoted to lead the group’s telecom venture. One individual who opted out of the race was former IAS officer Sanjay Ubale, till recently the head of the infrastructure and urban solutions at Tata Sons, who decided to join the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.


Crank CallsThe daughter of a senior MNC executive started getting some crank calls. He called the operator to see what could be done. He was told that the caller was from a rival in Uttar Pradesh (East). The official then called up the rival operator, only to be told that the caller actually belonged to the first operator, but from Uttar Pradesh (West). The flabbergasted official realised that this was being reduced to a blame game and has since dropped both telcos in question and ported to a third one! Thankfully, the calls have also stopped.


Poll TalkNot everyone seems to be certain whether the election will provide a decisive verdict. One leading industrialist declared that the “real India will surprise the rest.” He may be onto something, as his network and products are deeply entrenched in rural India as much as they are in the metros.


Nothing OfficialJust days before PepsiCo withdrew all cases against potato farmers in Gujarat for alleged rights infringement, Asia, Middle East and North Africa chief executive Mike Spanos flew in for a visit. While the company has maintained that the trip was a routine one that had been planned in advance, speculation is rife about what long-term impact the potato episode could have on the multinational. Some cite the examples of two large MNCs — Nestle and Amway — which replaced expats with Indians to weather storms.


Dial A for AfricaIndian telcos, network vendors, global roaming and mobile number portability (MNP) service providers with big business interests in Africa are headed to the Rwandan capital, Kigali, later this week to participate in the Smart Africa tech conclave, starting May 14. Participants will brainstorm on ways to transform Africa into a unified, digital economy with access to affordable broadband and roaming services across the continent. Desi telecoms, software services firms and gear makers see the Smart Africa jamboree as a stepping stone to deepen their business engagement in the continent."

Analyst calls

 • ICICIdirect has downgraded PVR to hold and has a target price of ₹1,910 on it. The multiplex industry continues to be in a sweet spot as content continues to perform well while some major issues of higher GST for tickets and public outcry on higher F&B prices seem to be behind now, said ICICIdirect. PVR remains a key beneficiary of such structural tailwinds, it added. 

 • Antique Stock Broking has maintained hold rating on South Indian Bank with a target price of ₹16. With net stress loans at 5.4% of loans and weak core profitability, South Indian Bank in a tough spot and turnaround in earnings is likely to be a long journey, it said. The brokerage expects RoA to gradually improve to 0.6% by FY21. While valuations are reasonable at 0.5 times FY21 book value, the bank lacks structural triggers for a re-rating, said Antique. 

 • IIFL has a buy rating on Larsen & Toubro with a target price of ₹1,783. L&T ticked all boxes in FY19, despite the challenging liquidity environment and cost headwinds in Infra, said IIFL. An RoE and cash flow focused approach has further strengthened its balance sheet, which will, aptly, be utilised for the execution of complex and large projects, it added. As core earnings gear for 25-30% CAGR over FY19-21, led by a strong order book of ₹2,934 billion, valuations at 19 times FY21 core EPS are attractive, it added. 

 • CLSA has maintained sell rating on Voltas and revised target price to ₹487 from ₹500. Voltas' Q4 EBITDA missed estimate by 40% with disappointment in both unitary cooling products and its project business, said CLSA. The current market price implies 40 times multiple for UCP segment core profit, which is expensive, it said. With other income forming 26% of its FY19 PBT, current multiples are not sustainable, said CLSA.

 • Morgan Stanley has an overweight rating on Cyient with a target price of ₹720. The firm believes that the stock lacks near-term triggers because first quarter performance could be volatile. However,valuation is cheap and Street expectations have already come down, said Morgan Stanley. F urther optionality of successful execution in business transition from services-led to solutions-led make riskreward favourable, it said."

Analyst calls• Elara Capital has retained buy rating on Parag Milk Foods with a target price of ₹366. Parag Milk Foods has reported high growth by expanding into north and east India while keeping working capital under control, said Elara. As the company reduces skimmed milk products salience and increases liquid milk or VAD salience in FY20, margin should move up to 10%, said Elara. 

• Morgan Stanley has retained equal-weight rating on Dalmia Bharat with a target price of ₹1,176. EBITDA miss in the fourth quarter reflects lowerthan-expected volume and higher costs, said Morgan Stanley. While Dalmia Bharat's growth in the east will be constrained by captive clinker availability, management expects overall growth to be in line with industry, said Morgan Stanley. Deleveraging is on track, but uncertainty remains on investments, it said. 

• CLSA has maintained buy rating on Inox Leisure and revised target price to ₹394 from ₹365. Recently completed preferential issue to the promoters and Inox’s strong balance sheet puts it in a strong position to drive both organic and inorganic growth, said CLSA. The brokerage raised FY20/21 estimates by 7-8%. Valuations at 9.5 times one-year forward EV/Ebitda, which is at a 20% discount to five-year average, appear reasonable, said CLSA. 

• Jefferies has maintained underperform rating on Vodafone Idea and revised target price to ₹12 from ₹13. The brokerage said Vodafone Idea's fourth quarter results were better than expected. Jefferies said price hikes are unlikely in FY20 and can happen only once Jio becomes a dominant player with 40% plus market share, which is likely in FY21. Jefferies expects Vodafone Idea's market share to fall to 20% and Bharti to remain steady at 30% by FY22, it said. 

• Citigroup Global Markets has maintained buy rating on ITC and raised target price of ₹370 from ₹360. The cigarette business continues to deliver healthy volumes, enabling a base for price hikes in the medium term, said Citigroup. The brokerage has raised EPS estimates marginally by 1%-3% on 32 times September 2020 estimated EPS. ITC is trading below its 5-year mean P/E valuation and 30-35% discount versus peer group is compelling, said Citi.

9,2019-05-15,Nestle,"Prabhudas Lilladher has given an accumulate recommendation on Nestle India with a target price of Rs 10,742.

Shares of Nestle India traded at Rs 10,378.05 around 3 pm on 15 May, 2019. The brokerage has set a one-year horizon for the stock to hit the target price.


March quarter highlights:


Net sales grew 8.9 per cent to Rs 3,000 crore led by domestic sales growth of 10.2 per cent and volume growth across brands.
Export sales were down 8.9 per cent due to lower coffee exports to Turkey.
Gross margins were down by 57bps to 58.53 per cent due to higher input costs of Wheat, Palm Oil and SMP despite lower coffee and benign sugar prices.
Ebitda grew 5.3 per cent to Rs 750 crore. Ebitda margins down by 86bps to 25 per cent on lower gross margins and 36bps increase in staff costs. Adjusted PAT increased 8.2 per cent to Rs 475 crore, aided by 40bps lower depreciation and 30 per cent increase in other income.


Investment rationale:

The brokerage believes that input costs led margin tailwinds are over for the company. However, it has cut the CY19 and CY20 earnings per share (EPS) estimates of the company by 0.4 per cent and 3.6 per cent, respectively. 

""We now factor in120bps decline in gross margins in CY19 and 30bps in CY20,"" said the brokerage. 

The brokerage also highlighted the fact that Nestlé’s Q1CY19 numbers show 10.2 per cent domestic sales growth, against 12 per cent in Q418, in a challenging operating environment, showing success of new launches and volume focused strategy. 

""We believe success of new launches and sustained innovation pipeline holds key to growth sustenance. We expect medium term levers to play out, led by improved demand growth momentum on the back of rural package, cluster based strategy to go deeper and increase sales in interiors and strong innovation and renovation with high success rates,"" said the brokerage. 

The brokerage estimates 11.9 per cent Ebidta and 12.8 per cent PAT CAGR over CY18-20 and value the stock at 46 times March21 EPS to arrive at the target price of Rs 10,742 from Rs 10,828 earlier."
8,2019-05-15,Nestle,"Historical evidence probably suggests that markets move on once the mandate is out, said Mayuresh Joshi, Fund Manager, Angel Broking, in an interview with ETNOW. Edited excerpts:

Should one not unnecessarily worry about the selling which has surprised us in last eight-nine days?
It is a complex host of factors that are converging at the same time -- the expectations of election outcome and the final bearing that the election outcome has in terms of how the markets react and the correlation of market returns vis-à-vis the elections. 

The market has probably ignored the election mandate on most of the cases. Unless there is a fractured mandate this time around, the markets should largely be bypassing this event irrespective of what probably comes out through the exit polls or otherwise. If you look at the last three mandates – 2004, 2009 and 2014 -- the date at which the elections were announced, the actual outcome of elections and where the markets were at the end of the year, the markets have always ended up higher. There are these sentimental reasons attached with the markets but the historical evidence probably suggests that markets move on once the mandate is out.


How are you assessing Nestle’s commentary that looks positive if you were to look at just the operational numbers. Is there a bit of contraction in line with the rest of the industry?
Oh yes, that has been the case. The large element in terms of the input cost inflation, specifically the milk prices, have had an impact in terms of how the gross margins for Nestle have panned out for this quarter. The expectation was largely that there would be a slight contraction because of all these factors, both in terms of gross as well as EBITDA margins. 

Overall, the volume-led growth has been very encouraging. The management commentary clearly indicates that demand momentum will remain very strong. It is more urban centric market for Nestle at this point of time with the products and the SKUs that they have got. The urban markets are probably held on this time around. We are seeing far more discretionary spending -- distortions play out for the larger universe which probably caters to the rural markets. 

From an expectation on earnings profile, the consistency in numbers should play out. The new launches would probably entail higher ad spends and that would also have a say in terms of how the margins pan out but a large element in terms of consistent earnings is still being re-played by Nestle over the next few quarters. If you own the stock, continue to hold it.


Do you track SRF?
Yes and we do hold the stock in our funds as well. There has been a good set of numbers. The management had pointed out that speciality chemicals is expected to bounce back and it has bounced back very sharply. This segment will deliver the kind of earnings trajectory that one really expects it to do over the next few quarters. 

The other elements in terms of EBIT margins did hold up and in terms of input costs, fluorspar prices probably moved higher. But they have probably stabilised at this point of time. Prices. specifically in terms of BOPET business which is the packaging business -- with facilities in both India and abroad (Hungary and Thailand) should start performing well because of demand. 

SRF probably still remains intact compared to what BOPP films might do at this point of time. So again, a large element in terms of earnings momentum remaining, strong margins remaining extremely strong and improving thereafter, should hold the story for SRF. 

One might argue that valuations probably are on the higher side but again it is the same old story. If investors are probably holding on to the stock, it might give you consistent returns.


How are you approaching elections? Are you fully invested or are you sitting on cash? 
We did have a churn done in our portfolios as well. But again on sharp declines, there has been a conscious effort to look at deploying at least 10-15% of the cash into qualitative stocks. As you rightly pointed out, in the different segments, growth still seems to be very robust and though the banking universe has moved up very sharply, our own sense is that credit growth should slowly and steadily start picking up even from the current levels. 

You are apparently seeing certain signs of that. You are witnessing liquidity crunch at this point of time. But as that normalises over the next few months, the well capitalised private or public sector banks should enjoy the entire disbursement cycle with better capital adequacy ratios and that should also support their earnings growth. 

The second element would be the infrastructure spending. If the existing government does come through the kind of plans that they had made for infra spending, that might help a lot of infra related companies. A few of the capital good players might witness slower order flows because of the elections this time around and slower execution because of monsoons. But there will be definite order flows coming through on that front. 

Our focus is on cement companies where good volume-led realisation growth and utilisation levels should play out on the earnings and leverage these companies. Within the larger universe, a few of the gold financing companies in the NBFC space have seen earnings being held up and continuing to hold up in the next few quarters. For the consumption theme, again staples and a select few players within the paper and hotel space look to be very interesting themes for the market over the next few quarters.


While consumption has taken a hit and slowdown has lasted for a good four-five months, you are not really seeing that from construction activity -- be it L&T numbers, their commentary or the robust numbers reported by cement majors.
That seems to be the case. For capital goods/cement players, a lot of order flows have come in the past quarter. But again, with the national elections coming through, this quarter’s order numbers will be very muted and a lot of companies have hinted at that. 

The second element is the onset of monsoon. As Skymet has predicted, since it is a case of near normal monsoon, the execution capabilities will be a little dampened for a lot of these capital goods/cement players. But for this quarter in particular, execution has been pretty robust. The expectations in terms of the guidance given out for a company like L&T has probably disappointed a tad bit on the margins. But the overall order book, the revenue visibility and expectations of their working capital remaining very low leading to significant improvement in ROEs that remains a very solid story over the next few years. 

For cement players again, the expectations for volume growth has started picking up. The expectations in terms of demand actually surpassing supply expectations over the next few years and utilisation levels inching up with input costs remaining a little bit on the softer side, should create the necessary amount of leverage. We remain positive on stocks like L&T within the larger universe. For the cement space, in stocks like UltraTech, Ramco Cement and India Cements are where our positive divergence still remains."
11,2019-05-16,Nestle,"After a 10-year blast up of consumption and a 10-year fall in savings, it makes sense if for 2-4 years, the savings rate recovers back to where we were 9-10 years ago, which is around 25%, said Saurabh Mukherjea, Founder, Marcellus Investment Managers, in an interview with ETNOW.Edited excerpts:


Are we reaching a level where one should be looking for bargains rather than focussing too much on the election permutation and combination? 
I have always felt elections are relatively irrelevant to Indian equities at two levels. First, as I have said several times, I do not think any political party in our country really has the answers to the big policy questions, the big economic issues of our era; such questions as to how do we improve the health of this financial system, how do we create jobs, how do we create social security safety net etc. In the absence of politicians having answers to the questions which really matter, I am not so sure it makes a difference either way who comes to power on 23rd, 24th May. So that is a fundamental reason. 

Secondly, the challenge with the Indian market as I have been saying for the last couple of years has been that it has been overvalued -- 26 times trailing earnings or 29 times trailing earnings. The market is still overvalued and until that overvaluation corrects, I am not so sure overall market level buying will make a great deal of sense even now, regardless of who wins on 23rd May. 



These two points make the elections a non-event for investors. Where I am getting interest is say a situation like ITC. It is a classic coffee can company -- 10% revenue growth, 15% ROC. It meets those criteria comfortably over long periods of time. It is a monopoly for all intents and purposes in cigarettes; it has got a chairman and an MD who knows the company inside out but the stock has not done that much in three, four years. That is the kind of situation which always appeals to me, a high quality dominant franchise, but it does not seem to me that the market has really priced to a level where it becomes unattractive. 

I am looking for bargains in companies where the franchise is superb but the market does not seem to appreciate it. I am not looking for bargains for the market as a whole in totality, which still looks too expensive to me.


You talk very positively about names like Asian Paints, Nestle. They are high quality franchises but it is interesting given the slowdown narrative that has been predominant over the last few weeks. When you are talking about long-term plays, would you still consider buying into some of these names at these levels?
If you are trying to make money in the Indian stock market what is really important is not to lose yourself in the noise and lose the signal. Nestle and Asian Paints have given the signal that they have given over the last 20 years, that in specific segments of the Indian economy, they have an absolutely dominant position. So Nestle’s case in baby milk powder from which comes the majority of their profits. They have almost 90% market share. 

In Asian Paint’s case, for the last 50 years, this company has had more than 50% market share in paints. On metrics like working capital cycle, ability to generate cash, ability to translate profits into cash, ability to drive high ROCE over long periods of time, Asian Paints is unrivalled. 

I suppose my team and I have developed such an appreciation for the strength of these franchises that we do not lose too much sleep over short-term developments. But if other investors out there can do the same, what you are able to buy is really world class franchises. World over, in the last 30-50 years, you will find very few companies which have performed like Asian Paints. It is up something like 1700 times since the IPO in 1983 and over the last 40 years, the underlying fundamentals have been quite unbelievable. 

If you take a longer view, and I am not saying take a decade-long view, even if we take a five-year view, franchises like ITC, Nestle, Asian Paints make you lots of money. If on the other hand, you choose to lose yourself on what will happen on 23rd May well you might be able to entertain yourself on the results day but it is not a particularly lucrative way to invest in a country like ours, which is giving you these incredible franchises which make tons of money.


Everyone says the slowdown is very short term in nature, that the consumer slowdown and the auto slowdown will pickup. What will it take for the demand to come back and historically what are the factors which have contributed to a comeback?
Two things; one, the slowdown is very selective. Look at Titan’s results. There is nothing called a slowdown in Titan’s results, if you speak to manufacturers of high-end apparel, it is not apparent that there is a massive slowdown in luxury consumption. Yes, there is one in auto and there is one in consumer durables, but that is for understandable reasons. Those sectors were funded through NBFC credit and we all know what is happening in the NBFC sector. 

The other thing which is worth doing is just zoom back up and look at what has happened in the last 10 years. Ten years ago, India’s household savings rate was around 25%. Over the 10 years, it has dropped to something like 17%. That is great news for consumption, but that is not very good news from a savings perspective! 

Banks are struggling to get deposits and the problems the NBFC sector is facing is in attracting money. We do need resumption and a recovery in savings in our country to infuse low cost capital into the financial system, into the banking system and therefore, after a 10-year blast up of consumption and a 10-year fall in savings it does make sense for two, three, four years the savings rate does recover somewhere back to where we were nine, 10 years ago which is around 25%. 

From both perspectives, it is worth not overplaying the consumption slowdown. It is not across the board and looking at the big picture over the last 10 years, where we have had a steady decline over a decade in the household savings rate, it is worthwhile pushing that savings rate up because it helps a large sector in our country; the financial services sector. I am not that fussy about this consumption slowdown. It has been overplayed by people who want to create an excuse for why they have bought the wrong sorts of companies. 


Besides ITC, which you said is a perfect Coffee Can Investment portfolio stock idea, where else are you digging out the opportunities?
So, if we go back to the great Rob Kirby’s investment philosophy that he laid out in 1984, we should look for companies which over a decadal period, can give you steady performance year after year. The frontline Indian private sector banks, especially HDFC Bank and Kotak Bank (both are in our client’s portfolios). HDFC Bank and Kotak Bank fit that description very nicely. They have demonstrated over the last 10 years an ability to stay clear of these epic NPA disasters that seem to befall other banks -- both public and private. 

Going into what looks to be a fairly significant financial crisis, they have been going with ample fire power -- both in terms of tier one and a strong CASA franchise. 

Kotak Bank size is now over above 50% which is quite unbelievable in the Indian context. If you want to go beyond consumer and say you are losing sleep about the consumer slowdown, then look at the financial services sector where a combination of sclerotic PSU banks and troubled NBFCs sector is basically going to concentrate the entire lending activity into the hands of four perhaps five private sector banks. The top two are HDFC Bank and Kotak.

It is a very interesting situation in private sector banks. It is very rare to be able to sit in a market and see the entire concentration of economic activity in one sector getting focussed on three or four companies. We are seeing that in private sector banking in India today.


Does it make sense to buy a Bajaj Finance even though it is 6-8 times price to book?
I reckon NBFCs will emerge from this ongoing crisis. The NBFCs will stand tall and I would put a Bajaj Finance in that list. There are three specific things in works for this company which I think are quite rare anywhere in the world. First, you have not just the large corporate backing, but a cash generative cooperate group. There are others in India which have large corporate groups’ backing them, but very few of those corporate groups have an outstanding cash machine in the form of Bajaj Auto and the broader group. 

The second is, Bajaj Finance has worked very hard to reduce the duration of its asset. Then the entire portfolio is not housing finance or real estate developer finance. The portfolio stand is made much lower by auto finance and consumer durable finance. 

Thirdly, intriguingly, in 2017 and the early part of 2018, when every other borrower was reducing the tenure of their liability and looking for shorter and shorter dated money. Bajaj Finance from what I can see the annual report did not do that, they dragged up the tenure of their liability. So, if you have a longer-dated liability, shorter-dated assets, you are crunching the asset liability mismatch down. You got a big cash generating corporate group behind you and over and above that you have got a competent management. It is a good combination and as I said repeatedly, I have never lost that much sleep about short-term valuations for franchises of this quality. It is a part of several of our client’s portfolios.


But choose between an HDFC Bank or a Bajaj Finance. There are sometimes compulsions. You cannot buy both and if somebody has a compulsion for a three-year time frame, which one will make more money?
It is a very tough question I would rather not answer the question. My point is if you got two flares coming up which are going to make lots of money, why worry about choosing? I would have both in my portfolio.


You see growth impacting auto and auto ancillaries in particular, the shift to EVs and also the entire ride sharing phenomenon. What kind of impact do you see there?
I will caveat all of this by saying we are not experts in EV. We are not experts in this whole shift to electric. We read the same newspapers and articles on the internet that you guys do. But what it looks to us is that a combination of policy pressure, policy pressure from governments around the world and the fact that growing scale is making electric batteries and electrical vehicles cheaper. It does mean that our auto industry will also transition to a place probably 10 years hence. Perhaps 30% of cars on our roads will be EV. 

So the old-fashioned ICE cars now going to die away very soon. But it does look that there is a transition underway. Obviously that begs the question as to which Indian auto EM will be able to deal with it. So the auto situation is quite interesting. I do not think the near-term cyclical downturn will last indefinitely. Sooner or later. we will come out of the near-term cyclical downturn. 

But there is the longer-term question as well. How do the giant auto OEMs, which are ICE driven, companies like Maruti, M&M reposition themselves? These are well managed companies. They will find a way out of this cycle, out of the ICE and into the EV world. But I think free cash flow will get squeezed. As these companies take out more money to invest in the EV platforms first an R&D, then in manufacturing I think return on capital employed and free cash flow will come down which in turn has a bearing on what sort of long term valuations the auto OEMs can command. So I would be careful about jumping into buying autos saying that the sector is bottomed out. I think the scale of investment is necessary by the auto OEMs to transition to EV will be quite substantive. The impact to long-term valuations could therefore be quite meaningful.


Let’s touch upon money markets as well. We all know what the market wants. What are you anticipating or what are you pricing in?
I do not think the central bank has that much choice. Look at the scale of challenges facing us in the financial system and the RBI has to keep the system flushed with liquidity. It has done as good a job as it possibly could be expected to do in the last seven-eight months. 

Second, I think we need another 25 bps rate cut. We are in a pretty tricky situation both in terms of bringing down the short term cost of money and in terms of system liquidity infusion. RBI should do as much as it can to take us through what will be a pretty tricky summer for the CP and the NCD market."

Board meetings (FULL LIST)
 

Analyst calls
 • Jefferies has maintained buy rating on Nestle India with a target price of ₹12000. Jefferies continues to like Nestle's focus on volume led growth and diversification of the portfolio. Launch of 40 new products in the last 2-3 years and entry into new categories such as dips, breakfast cereals (scalable), premium chocolates, RTD formats, coffee machine etc. will help sustain growth momentum, it said. 

 • HSBC has maintained buy rating on Equitas Holdings and revised target price to ₹158 from ₹160. The brokerage believes that Equitas’ offerings, on the assets side as well as its branch positioning and pricing on the deposits side, position it well to grow loans at about 33% CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) through FY21. Slightly higher credit costs and lower NIMs drive marginal earnings cut, it said. RoEs should cross 10% in FY20 and 13% by FY21, driven by improving leverage, said HSBC. 

• Morgan Stanley has maintained overweight rating on Just Dial and revised target price to ₹680 from ₹605. Over the last few quarters, Just Dial has shown good recovery in revenue growth, led by volume growth, said Morgan Stanley. The firm expects current momentum to continue, based on operating metrics such as addition to ""feet on street"" headcount, sustained traffic growth, and healthy increase in deferred revenues. 

• Credit Suisse has initiated coverage on PI Industries with an outperform rating and target price of ₹1,300. PI can deliver a 20% plus EPS CAGR over the next few years, said Credit Suisse. Given its unique business model, high probability of non-linear growth in coming years and option value from acquisition or branching out into other chemical segments like pharma, this premium multiple will sustain, it said. 

• CLSA has retained buy rating on Union Bank of India and cut target price to ₹96 from ₹105. Union Bank may see earnings normalize from FY21 onwards, said CLSA. With the recent capital infusion, CET I is now 8% and Tier I CAR is 9.5%, but this has diluted BVPS, it added. The brokerage has cut its target price because of this but retained buy rating given reasonable valuation and better CASA franchise.

Edelweiss Alternative Research"
12,2019-05-18,Nestle,"RBL Bank and HDFC Life from financials, Nestle and ITC from consumption and KEC International among midcaps should be accumulated in case of dips, said Jagannadham Thunuguntla, Senior Vice President and Head of Research, Centrum Broking, in an interview with ETNOW. Edited excerpts:


News of promoter fights spook investors considerably. How worried should minority investors be as they are just caught in the cross-fire?
Globally, aviation is a very difficult industry to make money and to run. Hardly have aviation companies really created wealth for the investors. Many people thought IndiGo was an exception in generating investor wealth and being profitable. 

Let us hope that IndiGo is not throwing away the advantage that it built up over the last 10 years and especially since Jet Airways is folding up and the entire market share is up for grabs. But at that opportune time, it is quite disturbing that promoters instead of focussing on making IndiGo stronger, are indulging in creative differences. This is a matter of great concern for the company as well as the industry. Let us hope that sanity prevails. 

Both the promoters should be able to come to a conclusion quite soon because time is very precious and in each passing day, they are missing an opportunity to grab market share. IndiGo will remain the market leader. Even for the country’s economy, we are in need of low-cost airline with a strong market share. IndiGo has all the makings and let us hope they do not throw away the opportunity when opportunity was knocking on their doors.


What is your initial reaction on the merger of the consumer division of Tata Chemicals with Tata Glabal? The Tatas have not historically been very successful when it comes to consumer staples businesses.
Markets are extremely happy that under the leadership of Mr Chandrasekaran, finally the senior management is looking at even the smaller parts of the Tata Group. Traditionally, all the major focus and major energies have been diverted towards TCS and Tata Steel and Tata Motors, because understandably they are large companies. 

Many of the smaller companies of the Tata Group always received only that much attention. Markets are happy that finally a shareholder-friendly move has been done to ensure the value unlocking and to align the interest and to set the business model in such a fashion that all the consumer-related things will come under one umbrella. 

It is a matter of great comfort for the investors that the management has started thinking about them. This is one of the reasons both the stocks have done phenomenally well post that announcement. And, of course, EPS is a function of financials. We will see how things pan out once the merger is done. Over the next one-two years, we will know but to start with, it is a great move by the Tatas. Let us hope that the shareholder friendliness that they exhibited will sustain even into the other parts of the Tata Group companies.


How perturbed should investors be with respect to what is happening in pharma and the kind of fall we have seen in the week gone by?
It is quite disturbing. For the last one to two years, pharma was ranked as an underperformer and some investors were hoping for a contrarian trade. There may be a chance of some uptick in the beaten down pharma companies. But the developing news on the US lawsuit is adding fuel to the fire on the downside. It will probably take a lot more time for the pharma companies to make a comeback. 

Many of them have beaten down very badly from their all-time highs or even 52-week highs. But unfortunately, the entire investor and fund managing community today is betting more on banks and other industries. Pharma is probably the lowest in terms of the focus at this moment. 

This will continue for some more time. The best era of pharma was a decade earlier, more or less. From here, it is at best a contrarian trade, just that the bad news flow is not stopping.


For those investors with a longer-term horizon, what is looking attractive in this market?
Most of the political discussions should be over next week. Let us not give too much weightage to it. After that, again the discussion will get back into economy earnings, employment, monsoon and so on. That is where the major worry is because the earning season that is building up is not at all a great one. 

There were lots more disappointments than success stories. Once the election narrative is done, there is a very good chance that the market may cool off, giving extra opportunity for investors to accumulate good quality names. 

On the financial side, we are comfortable with RBL Bank and HDFC Life and we are also positive on ITC and Nestle. Even on consumption, there are major challenges in terms of a slowdown but Nestle and ITC both have given good results and being market leaders, we believe they can weather through the current slowdown of the consumption. 

We have also added KEC International, one of the midcap companies. These are some of the names which in case of market correction, one can gradually accumulate for the longer term point of view."
13,2019-05-18,Nestle,"It is lunchtime on a weekday and there’s a hubbub of hungry customers around the counter at Cannon food stall, opposite south Mumbai’s iconic Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus railway station. Employees at the 46-year-old establishment are doing double-speed, rush-hour duty, against the clang of steel plates and swirl of shouted orders, to serve its most popular dish — pav bhaji.

It is definitely not for the calorie-conscious. The pav (bread) glistens with golden butter and a generous slab of butter, the size of a small soap bar, slowly melts into the hot bhaji. That only seems to boost the demand for “Amul Pav Bhaji”, advertised prominently on the menu board for Rs 100. Appa Dandekar, who runs Cannon, says the stall has always used Amul and there is no question of using any other butter brand. “People can tell the difference between Amul and others.”

This kind of devotion to Amul Butter is what makes it the undisputed market leader, accounting for around 85% of the Rs 3,500 crore butter market in India, according to industry sources. More than six decades after it was launched, Amul Butter has managed to hold onto its dominance.

In the hyper competitive world of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) — a low-margin, distribution and marketing-focused universe where customer loyalties tend to be fickle — a handful of legacy brands such as Amul Butter has managed to retain their market leadership over decades, fending off rivals, rapidly changing tastes and shifting market structures.

 In some cases, the dominance is such that the category is defined by the brand. Instant noodles brand Maggi, Dabur Chyawanprash, Parle G, Rooh Afza and Diary Milk among food and drinks and Pidilite’s Fevicol, an adhesive, are among these logic-defying brands. 

All of them have been around for a while, making it clear that customer loyalty is earned slowly, but surely. But apart from longevity and the consistent nurturing of the brand itself, there is little that’s discernibly common among them. Each product has had its own journey and challenges. So what lessons in success and leadership can be gleaned from the journey of these powerhouse brands?


Recall Value
 For one, being a strong brand does not guarantee safety. Amul, for example, has to fight for market share with Parag Milk Foods and Britannia in cheese, and Nestle and Mother Dairy battle Amul in the packaged milk category. Amul’s market share in the cheese and milk segments are pegged at 40-50% and 30%, respectively.

Research firms such as Nielsen and Euromonitor do not share market share figures with the media, and some market segments, such as butter, are not extensively tracked. ET Magazine has relied on data from industry sources, including figures from syndicated reports by market research firms.

But why do people invariably think of Amul while buying butter? Shirish Upadhyay, a dairy industry veteran who has worked in the private sector and with the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF), which owns the brand Amul, says Amul had a head start in butter.

The dairy sector was delicensed in 1991 but the brand had been launched in the 1950s and its famous “Utterly Butterly” slogan and the Amul girl created in 1966. “And it is very competitively priced so it doesn’t make sense for others to take on Amul.”



Amul ButterCompany: Amul, Market share of Amul Butter: 85%, Competitors: Heritage, Mother Dairy, Britannia
 “There is a conscious effort to talk to younger people through Amul ads” Rahul da Cunha, ad man behind Amul
Another reason is the distinct salty taste that Amul Butter had developed to take on then-market leader, Polson’s Butter, in the 1950s.

Butter, which helped Amul build a national distribution network, has the highest cross-country penetration among all its products, says RS Sodhi, managing director of GCMMF. The company also sells ghee, buttermilk, ice cream and chocolates. GCMMF earned a revenue of Rs 33,150 crore in 2018-19. “People have blind faith in the Amul Butter brand, like they have on their religion.”

Rahul da Cunha, one of the brains behind the Amul girl advertisements, says one of the reasons for the endurance of the brand is its attempt to talk to younger people. “We are commenting not just on topics of national importance but also on topics of internet importance.”


Riding on Nostalgia
Another popular brand that also used a little girl for branding is Parle-G biscuits. The packaging of the product launched in 1939 uses a picture of a little girl. Owned by Parle Products, the biscuit is a daily fixture in the lives of many Indians who like dunking it in their tea.

 “You might try different biscuits. But when you want to have something every day, it is Parle-G,” says Mayank Shah, category head at Parle Products. The biscuit accounts for fourfifths of the Rs 8,750 crore glucose biscuit market and operates at staggering scale. Available at 10 different price points from Rs 2 (with eight biscuits) to Rs 65 (with 160 biscuits), Parle-G is sold through 6.5 million outlets. A billion packets are sold every month. In 2011, Nieslen called it the world’s largest-selling biscuit. The brand’s chief competitors are Britannia’s Tiger and ITC’s Sunfeast Glucose, which account for a tenth of the market.

To take on the competition, Parle-G reinvented the brand and termed the “G” in the name “genius”. Shah says Tiger and Sunfeast only ate into the market share of the smaller players. Parle-G’s share has grown from 68% to 80% in the past two decades, he adds.



Parle-G Company: Parle Products Market share of Parle-G in glucose biscuits: 80%, Competitors: Tiger, Sunfeast Glucose
Britannia declined to comment for the story and ITC did not respond to queries. These two companies are no less aggressive when it comes to pricing and distribution, but Tiger and Sunfeast Glucose, launched in 1997 and 2003, respectively, do not — at least not yet — have Parle-G’s biggest selling point — a multi-generational connection with the brand.

Nostalgia certainly helps a brand, says Siddharth Shekhar Singh, associate professor of marketing at the Indian School of Business. “But if customers don’t find value in it, then (future) generations may remember the brand but not use it.”

Anil Viswanathan, director of marketing (chocolates), Mondelez India, concurs. “Nostalgia is a dangerous thing. The moment you are rooted in the past, there is only one direction you are going to go.”

Mondelez accounts for twothirds of the Rs 10,430 crore chocolate market in India, according to Nielsen data shared by industry insiders. Their flagship brand Cadbury Dairy Milk, launched in India in 1948, alone has a 41% market share.

There was a time most Indians did not have access to have premium chocolates and made do with whatever was available. But, Viswanathan says, that started changing around a decade ago when people realised there were no good premium chocolates in India. That was when the company launched Dairy Milk Silk, which starts at Rs 70. The company’s premium range of chocolates like Silk and Bournville necessitated an increase in the number of coolers in stores.



Dairy Milk has also been helped in no small measure by some of India’s most memorable commercials and taglines since the 1990s, created by Ogilvy & Mather (O&M), including “Asli swad zindagi ka (The real taste of life)” and “Kuchh meetha ho jaaye (Let’s have something sweet)”.

 “Nostalgia is a dangerous thing for brands. The moment you are rooted in the past, there is only one direction you are going to go” Anil Viswanathan, director of marketing (chocolates), Mondelez
Smart advertising, also by O&M, has also built Fevicol and its associate brands like Fevikwik and M-Seal. Owned by Pidilite Industries, the brands are said to control around 70% of the adhesives market. In a largely unorganised industry, Fevicol has the stickiness its competitors would kill for. A June 2017 research report by Credit Suisse on Pidilite says the incentive for carpenters to switch to another brand was low, as adhesives make up only 1-2% of the cost of making furniture.






Fevicol Company: Pidilite Market share of Fevicol 70% & Associate Brands like Fevikwik: Competitors: Jivanjor, Araldite

One of the secrets to the brand’s success was that unlike its competitors, it did not go just to distributors, but also engaged the end-users, in this case carpenters, masons and plumbers. In 2002, it even started a club for carpenters, the first of its kind, through which it conducts training programmes and cultural events for carpenters’ families. This club, which now has 1 lakh members in 600 towns, allows them to showcase new products to carpenters, a luxury Pidilite’s competitors do not have.

Just like Fevicol is used to refer to adhesives in general, rose-flavoured sherbets are in some quarters referred to as Rooh Afza. The Hamdard Laboratories’ brand, which reportedly accounts for nearly half of the Rs 1,000 crore syrup and concentrate market, was in the news recently because there was a shortage of the product during Ramzan. A large section of people break their iftar fast with Rooh Afza.

The market leader faces no real competition in some product categories. But there are also segments where newer players have given the top brand a serious scare. One such segment is chyawanprash. The product was long synonymous with Dabur, which has a nearly 60% share in the Rs 540 crore market. Baba Ramdev’s Patanjali has within a few years of its launch become the third largest player in the market, after Dabur and Baidyanath. But the sheen has started wearing off Patanjali due to increasing competition and distribution woes.

While Dabur and Baidyanath saw their market shares by volume rise in 2018-19 from 2017-18, Patanjali’s declined. Prashant Agarwal, marketing head-health supplements, Dabur, says Patanjali had a short-term impact and Dabur has made up for the loss in market share. “While people associate chyawanprash with winters, we are trying to get them to also buy it during other seasons, like monsoons.”

Dabur Chyawanprash, launched in 1949, for a long time enjoyed the benefits of being India’s first branded chyawanprash. But with increasing competition, the company has made a concerted attempt to reach out to a younger consumer base through brand ambassadors like cricketer MS Dhoni and Bhojpuri film star Ravi Kishan, who is quite popular in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, and make chyawanprash more palatable to kids by launching it in flavors like mango and chocolate.

Unlike in chyawanprash, it was not competition that posed a threat to Nestle in instant noodles. Maggi was synonymous instant noodles. But the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India’s decision in June 2015 to recall Maggi noodles over the presence of lead beyond the permissible limit and due to misleading labelling related to monosodium glutamate gave the brand a severe beating. Six months later, Maggi was back on the shelves, though the market share had nearly halved from 80% in 2014, according to Nestle data.



“While people associate chyawanprash with winters, we are trying to get them to also buy it during other seasons, like monsoons” Prashant Agarwal marketing head, health supplements, Dabur

However, the power of the brand and the company’s outreach saw Maggi through those trying times. The product’s market share is now almost 60%, according to Nestle. “It was quite telling who consumers were willing to trust, the government or Maggi,” says Alpana Parida, MD of DY Works, a brand consultancy.



Maggi, Company: Nestle Market share of Maggi: 59% Competitors: Wai Wai, Top Ramen,adequate

Brand Trap Nestle India did not respond to ET Magazine's specific questions, except to say Maggi has a strong resonance among consumers. Maggi's competitors include Sunfeast Yippee, Wai Wai and Top Ramen. Yippee, launched in 2010, has become the second largest brand, with a fifth of the market, riding ITC's distribution muscle, but it still does not immediately bring to mind noodles the way Maggi does.

Being a well-known brand of a big company can be a trap in itself. ""These companies are usually large-sized and due to their sheer size, it is challenging for them to be agile and provide a quick response to innovations and changing consumer needs,"" says Ina Dawer, research manager at Euromonitor International.

Staying relevant is a constant battle. The numerous onceubiquitous brands that have fallen by the wayside stand testimony to this brutal market truth."
14,2019-05-20,Nestle,"NEW DELHI: Domestic equity barometer Sensex vaulted over 950 points in early deals on Monday, propelled by exit polls that showed a clear and decisive majority for the Narendra Modi-led NDA in the general elections 2019.

The strong prospects of a stable government at the Centre gave a shot in the arm to the market even though it had been partly discounted earlier. Analysts say the rally could be even bigger if the results come in sync with these predictions.

""Most exit polls have predicted NDA to win the Lok Sabha elections with a good margin. This was partly discounted by the market over the past few days. The Street would like it even more if the BJP on its own gets a majority in the Lok Sabha. The fact that NDA may be able to attain the majority in Rajya Sabha only in 2020 or 2021 is a minor dampener as major reforms would need passage in both Houses,"" said Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research, HDFC securities.

15,2019-05-20,Nestle,"Mumbai: Women business leaders from India are increasingly forming part of multinational boardrooms, as global corporations try to gain a greater foothold in the country, with expertise in financial markets, banking, legal and technology working in their favour.

The illustrious list includes current and former chief executives at big-name corporations, such as Britannia’s Vinita Bali, McKinsey & Co’s Ireena Vittal, JP Morgan India’s Kalpana Morparia, Capgemini’s Aruna Jayanthi, HPE India’s Neelam Dhawan and Apollo Hospitals’ Preetha Reddy.

And, the latest on the roll is boutique investment bank Moelis’ Manisha Girotra, who has joined Naspers. A week ago, Naina Lal Kidwai, who helmed HSBC’s India operations, was also inducted into LafargeHolcim’s board.

“All these women have (made) great contribution and their selection would be entirely on merit, not just to tick the diversity box,” said Shailesh Haribhakti, chairman of audit and accounting company Haribhakti & Co. “Additionally, they have experience of working in India, which few other geographies can beat,” said Haribhakti, an independent director in many Indian companies.

New board appointments made up 11.4% of all board positions globally in 2018. Of that, 27% were women, up from 24.1% in 2016, according to executive recruitment firm Egon Zehnder.

“Globally, many boards are much more inclined to demonstrate diversity than we are in India, and the norm in many countries is 30% representation,” said Kidwai, who joined the board of the world’s largest cement and building materials company last week. A veteran banker, Kidwai had earlier served on the global board of Nestle for 12 years since 2006.

In India, women comprised 21.1% of new board appointments, 8.6 percentage points higher than the average in Asia of 12.5%, Egon’s Global Board Diversity Tracker 2018 survey showed.

“These women bring the coveted and much-valued experience of working in a large growth market where they have learnt to tackle tough and challenging business situations head-on,” said Pallavi Kathuria, managing partner for Egon Zehnder’s India offices.

Globally, 17.8% of committee chair positions are held by women. In India, women held 9.1% of committee chairs, compared to an average of 8.3% in Asia, the data showed. “Diversity is well acknowledged globally and there is enough buy in for women,” said Girotra, who heads Moelis India.

Naspers, the South African internet and media conglomerate, which made around $10 billion from a share sale in social media giant Tencent, sees India as a top market for capital allocation.

“India as a market is very important globally and boards feel (representation from) countries such as India and China is important on boards for more understanding,” Girotra said.

Already, several women from Latin America and Africa are on global corporate boards as companies have increased business presence in these regions.

“There’s an increasing demand for gender diversity, mandated or otherwise, on boards, which provides an opportunity for qualified women, including from India to join global boards,” said Vinita Bali, former head of Britannia.

Companies are being driven by mandates to represent more women on boards. Also, there are quite a few well-qualified top executives from sectors such as banking, financial services and technology, making them vital for global companies."
16,2019-05-24,Nestle,"By Nupur Acharya

A decisive mandate for India’s ruling coalition and a second term for Prime Minister Narendra Modi has assured investors of stability and policy continuity in Asia’s third-biggest economy.

Still, equity markets ended in the red after surging to an intraday record on Thursday as the result broadly matched investor expectations and was partly priced in after exit polls this week.

Political stability alone isn’t likely to drive continued outperformance by India’s equities or currency, with investors also weighing headwinds from softer domestic consumption, rising oil prices and a trade war. And valuations are already on the higher side: The benchmark S&P BSE Sensex trades at a 12-month blended forward price-to-earnings multiple of 18.3, above its five-year average.

“Markets are pricing in double-digit earnings growth over next few years. From a risk reward point of view, it is delicately balanced,” Nilesh Shah, chief executive at Kotak Asset Management Co., said in an email. “The direction will depend on steps that the government takes to accelerate growth.”

Here’s a snapshot of the winners and losers from India’s elections:


WINNERS

Agricultural Sector
In an interim budget in January, the government made clear that farmers are at the top of its agenda. The party aims to invest 25 trillion rupees ($359 billion) in rural development and offer farmers 6,000 rupees per year in income support. Also, it has planned increased spending on animal husbandry and fisheries.

Rural-focused companies including those providing seeds, pesticides, irrigation products, consumer staples and motorbike manufacturers stand to gain.

Watch Kaveri Seed, Prabhat Dairy and Avanti Feeds.


Infrastructure and Real Estate
During the campaign, Modi pledged to spend $1.44 trillion on repairing the country’s creaky infrastructure. Meanwhile, the government is already promoting affordable housing and has announced tax breaks to encourage buyers.

Winners include cement companies, pipes, tiles and sanitary-ware manufacturers, capital goods and infrastructure companies.

Larsen & Toubro, Sadbhav Engineering, Dilip Buildcon, Thermax, Bharat Heavy Electricals and Siemens Ltd. are some names that have already gained. In real estate, DLF Ltd., Godrej Properties and Sobha Ltd. have advanced.

“We can expect the government to continue pouring money into affordable housing and transport infrastructure,” said Kristy Fong, Asian equities investment director at Aberdeen Standard Investments, said in an email. “It could spark a renewed capital expenditure cycle.”

Financials
The financial sector could use a lot of help: A $190 billion mountain of stressed loans needs cleaning up and the cash woes at non-bank finance companies have hit loans for new homes, vehicles and consumer durables. Capitalization and consolidation in state-run banks is a key theme to watch.

State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, Bank of Baroda, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank are likely to benefit if the government tries to shore up the financial system.

“From a long term perspective, of about 3-5 years, the banking space exhibits signs of growth potential,” said Karthikraj Lakshmanan, a senior equities fund manager at BNP Paribas Asset Management India Pvt.


Consumption
For the top consumer companies that have been flagging a slowdown in demand, the mandate will offer some relief given the government’s plans to boost farm income at a time when the central bank is easing monetary policy. Staples, consumer durables and motorbike manufacturers stand to gain.

Watch companies like Hero Motocorp, Bajaj Auto, Exide Industries and Maruti Suzuki in the auto segment, along with consumer plays Hindustan Unilever, Nestle India and ITC Ltd.


LOSERS

Rupee
Optimism about a Modi victory buoyed the Indian rupee over the past three months, helping it to the best performance among major Asian peers. With elections out of the way foreign exchange investors are likely to refocus on rising oil prices, which will hurt India’s already wide current-account deficit, record government borrowings and headwinds from a U.S.-China trade war.


Bloomberg

Loan Defaulters
The government has led a crackdown on bad debt as it seeks to restore the health of the nation’s state-run banks. That drive -- supported by India’s two-year-old bankruptcy law -- is likely to continue after having already snared businesses including Anil Ambani’s Reliance Communications and Essar Group’s Essar Steel India Ltd."
17,2019-05-28,Nestle,"Investors holding the shares of fruit juice maker Manpasand Beverages should cut their losses and exit the stock as the company has come under scrutiny over corporate governance, say dealers and market experts.

Shares of the Vadodara-based company ended at the 20 per cent lower circuit at Rs 88 after its top executives were arrested by the Goods and Services Tax (GST) department officers for an alleged GST fraud.

The value of mutual funds’ holding of Manpasand Beverages fell to Rs 117 crore on Monday from Rs 146 crore on Friday (calculated on basis of shares held at the end of April), data compiled by ETIG Database showed.

“Retail investors should exit at whatever price they get as the suspicion is now confirmed. It does not make sense in holding such a stock,” said independent market expert Ambareesh Baliga.

In a regulatory filing on Saturday, the company said that the Commissioner of Central GST and Customs has carried out search and seizure proceedings at various premises of the company on Thursday and a further inquiry was conducted on Friday at the GST office in Vadodara. The company’s managing director Abhishek Singh, his brother Harshvardhan Singh and chief financial officer Paresh Thakkar were arrested.

The company told exchanges in its notification on Saturday that it is contesting these allegations in accordance with the due process of law.

“It is a negative development as top three business heads are now behind bars. The company has been seen as low on governance. The stock is likely to remain under pressure,” said Abneesh Roy, senior vice-president-institutional equities at Edelweiss Securities.

The stock listed on the bourses in July 2015 with its IPO price (adjusted) at Rs 160. The stock trebled to a lifetime high of Rs 511.83 in September 2017. In the last one year the stock has fallen 75 per cent.

The stock performance was hit significantly after Delotte Haskins and Sells LLP resigned as its auditor in May 2018, days before its earnings announcement, saying that significant information was not shared by the company for the purpose of audit of financial results. Manpasand on its part had termed the timing of this event as purely coinciental.

Baliga said the company’s turnover was under question even before Deloitte quit as auditor last year. One should invest in safer bets such as Hindustan Unilever, ITC, and Nestle India to bet on the consumer space, said Baliga."
0,2019-06-04,Nestle,"NEW DELHI: India Inc is planning to approach the Centre, after the re-election of the Narendra Modi-led NDA government, for further clarity on the anti-profiteering framework that has become important in the production landscape after New Delhi brought in a uniform producer levy. 

Companies are planning to make fresh representations for clear guidelines and regulations to be framed on profiteering, seeking avoid ambiguity whether manufacturers have passed on the Goods and Services Tax (GST) benefits to consumers in lockstep with tax cuts, officials aware of the developments said. 

“In our various interactions with the regulatory authorities, we have been seeking clear rules and guidelines on anti-profiteering,” said a spokesperson for the country's biggest consumer goods maker Hindustan Unilever ( HUL).

The NAA has passed orders against several companies following profiteering complaints. They include HUL (Rs 462 crore), Nestle (Rs 100 crore), Procter & Gamble (Rs 250 crore), Domino’s franchisee Jubilant FoodWorks Ltd (Rs 41.4 crore) and McDonald’s franchisee Hardcastle Restaurants (Rs 7.49 crore). 

The Directorate General of Anti-profiteering has charged the companies with profiteering from the reduction in goods and services tax by not passing on the benefits entirely to consumers. The companies have said they passed on benefits of lower taxes either by lowering prices or increasing the grammage of products.

A spokesperson for Nestle India said the company has passed on GST benefits to consumers. “We are hopeful that the procedure followed to pass on the GST benefit will be appreciated by the National Anti-Profiteering Authority and our stand will be vindicated,” the spokesperson for the Indian arm of the Swiss foods major said. “While we haven’t made any fresh representations, any measures towards greater clarity on rules and regulations with respect to anti-profiteering are always welcome,” the spokesperson added.



Others

The Nestle spokesperson said in situations where the benefit could not be passed on instantly by reduction in prices or increase in grammage, it had set aside Rs 16.6 crore to be subsequently passed on and the amount was not recognized either in sales or in profit. The money has been deposited in the government’s consumer welfare fund.

“While the intention behind this provision is understood, industry has been asking for guidelines as to how the benefits can be said to be 'passed on',” said Pratik Jain, national leader, indirect tax, PwC. “Now with possibility of further rate rationalisation (for example the merger of 12 and 18% rates), sectors such as real estate coming within the ambit and number of disputes already in courts, the GST council should look at coming up with guidelines as soon as possible.” 

Jain added that the possibility of the mechanism getting restricted only to complaints filed by consumers and not by third parties including government officials, should be explored to minimise such disputes, while still preserving it to be a consumer protection measure.

Email queries to P&G and Jubilant FoodWorks elicited no response. 

After the GST roll out in July 2017, in November the same year, the GST Council reduced tax slabs from 28% to 18% across 200 product categories including shampoo, detergent, cosmetics, chocolates, toothpaste and washing powder.

ET had reported in its May 16 edition that the anti-profiteering framework is likely to get an extension for another two years, following more likely changes to the GST structure."
1,2019-06-04,Nestle,"Probably the worst is factored into the prices of both Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland. I could see an additional amount of growth coming in for investors, if they have a horizon of at least one and a half to two years from now, making a good amount of alpha performance in their portfolios, said Deven Choksey, MD, KR Choksey Investment Managers, in an interview with ETNOW.Edited excerpts:


With the RBI revising norms on the exposure framework for banks, restricting it to just about 15% of their eligible capital base, how are you reading into this move for the overall NBFC sector? Do you have any favourites within the NBFC pocket?We continue to read some of the announcements coming in from the RBI and try to understand the implications because one would probably see higher possibilities for some of the quality NBFCs to understand the needs of the borrowers and then lend judiciously. In such a situation, a NBFC like Bajaj Finance definitely remains in the favourite list. It is an expensive one but the fact remains that they have proven themselves in the area of lending judiciously. From that perspective, this company should do comparatively better. 

I am not too sure but I think the favourite within our list also remains in the housing finance space -- both HDFC and Bajaj Housing Finance Company, which is part of Bajaj Finance. They remain relatively stable from the perspective of seeing a growth of 20% to 25% on a CAGR basis. 

We remain selective, we are over-boarding ourselves on to the NBFC story and at the same time, I do believe that there are regulatory measures which are likely to come up and would probably discipline some of the NBFCs at the same time. 

Stay with quality names that could be the mantra.


What exactly are you pencilling in by way of move by MPC on Thursday? The 10-year bond yields are sub 7% now. It seems the bond market is already pricing in a 50 bps rate cut. Is the equity market also working with the same assumption?I guess, 25 bps cut in the equities market is definitely pencilled in and discounted for, The way the FIIs swung into action yesterday and also the view of the bond market makes one think that there is the possibility of a little larger rate cut as well. However, my most important observation would be what are the measures the RBI is taking in order to ensure that the transmission of the interest rate cut happens in the system. 

In the last few attempts in the last two years, we have not seen enough repo rate cut by RBI and that is also not getting transmitted or passed on to the borrowers. So, the key would be to keep an eye on how the transmission takes place on the rate cut side. Should that happen, my gut feel says that in the following three months or so, you should be seeing a strong revival in the economy because the credit offtake would probably start improving from the current levels and that should result into higher amount of growth in the banking and consumption spaces.


Talking about consumption, some of these names like Nestle or Britannia are trading at close to high levels. Are they looking a little too expensive given the current outlook?On one side, you definitely want to buy these companies because probably they have created such a strong brand presence in the minds of the consumers and obviously the size, the distribution reach also suggest that these companies would be more solid on the ground as far as the growth aspect is concerned. 

We assume a growth of around 12 to 15% in these particular businesses on the FMCG side. However, the most important part out here would be that if these valuations have to turn reasonable, then one will have to see how the improvement in liquidity takes place. Currently, to a greater extent higher valuations can also be attributed to larger shareholding that these companies have from their parent side and relatively smaller amount in the market place with shareholders. That is an area which is factored well into the higher amount of earnings outlook. 

We do tell people that if you end up buying these particular companies, at least you are buying two or three years in advance before which, you will not start getting the actual value back into your books. That is a premium that you end up paying. Normally you end up paying a premium for around six months to one year whereas in this FMCG companies’ portfolio, you end up paying a premium of close to around two and a half to three years forward. That is where they become expensive. Yes, a meaningful correction would be a welcome opportunity to buy into quality FMCG names. 


How would you justify yesterday’s move and would you say that one can begin to bottom fish anywhere within autos?
I will keep an eye on two aspects; one a rate cut by the RBI and resultant transmission of this rate cut into the economy which could result into improvement in the demand in the auto space; to begin with, the areas where I feel more comfortable would be commercial vehicles and two-wheelers, largely because of the amount of money getting in the hands of the rural masses. That would probably lead to faster revival in the demand for two-wheelers.

As for commercial vehicles, the growth programme could accelerate going forward due to two reasons; one of course, is the BS-VI related demand generating higher amount of volume for most of the commercial vehicle companies including Ashok Leyland, Tata Motors, scrappage policy which is definitely on the cards. Implementation of the same could result into additional demand for the commercial vehicles. 

Not to forget. as the project gets completed, currently many of the infrastructure projects are under completion or maybe advanced stage of completion and we would see higher amount of demand getting generated because of the network of roads, railways, airports and seaports getting connected on the Bharatmala project. All these put together could result in better demand for commercial vehicles. My take is, it could be a good buying opportunity. Probably the worst is factored into the prices of both Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland. I could see an additional amount of growth coming in for investors, if they have a horizon of at least one and a half to two years from now, making a good amount of alpha performance in their portfolios."

3,2019-06-13,Nestle,"Suresh Narayanan, MD of Nestle India, recently shared with students the lessons that he has gleaned from the third letter of the alphabet.

He steered the company through a period of crisis, but Nestle India MD Suresh Narayanan called himself an unlikely example of a corporate captain while delivering the convocation address at the Great Lakes Institute of Management, Gurugram. Narayanan also shared with the students his C's of excellence, which include compassion, continuous learning and contentment. The other ones are:


Clarity
It’s important to know one’s purpose in life, according to Narayanan. “Your purpose in life is not just to be be a great corporate captain or entrepreneur or make millions of dollars, have four houses, six Ferraris and a beautiful wife or handsome husband,” he said. “Your purpose in life is deep. What is it that you want to be known for? And that clarity is important.”

Narayanan feels that life is too short to be stuck in a job you don’t love. “If you are not passionate about getting up in the morning and going to work, change your company. Change your vocation because that is not what life is meant to be,” he said.


AgenciesNarayanan feels that life is too short to be stuck in a job you don’t love.


Competence
Quoting one of Kabir’s dohas, Narayanan said, “Jaati na poochho sadhu ki, poochho lijiye gyan. Mol karo talwar ka, pada rehne do maayan [Don’t ask a saint his religion, ask him about him his knowledge. Value the importance of a sword than the sheath that holds it].” He added, “The problem is that we are always talking about the outer scabbard and not the sword. The sword is your competence. Integrity and ethics can only come your way if you have competence.”


Credibility
“As sure as a sunrise, as clear as a pond, no nasty surprises,” that’s credibility according to Narayanan. “We seldom focus on credibility. We focus more on technical skills. What is credibility? It means that when someone sees you they say that I can trust this person,” he said.

And it doesn’t come from the institutions that one has gone to. “You could have gone to institutions like Harvard, Stanford and MIT, but still lack credibility. You need to build this day by day, step by step. In difficult times, nobody is going to ask you for your gold medal. They will ask if you can be trusted,” he said.


Courage
Courage is not telling your boss that he is an idiot. Narayanan calls that “a career-limiting move, sheer stupidity”. “Courage means [being] gentle, firm, respectful and yet being able to say there is a better way,” he said. 

Narayanan told the students that in a meeting room they would come across three types of people. The first kind are the ones who come, have tea and biscuits and leave. The second is the naysayers, who are important to push you forward despite the hurdles. And the last ones, the ones to be wary of, are the jingoistic ones. They will applaud you as your designation expands, but they will be the first ones to disappear in a crisis. Narayanan urged the class to be in neither of these categories and to form a voice of their own.


Concentration
“You are a millennial generation. You are a multitasking generation. You can eat, drink, study, Whatsapp, and multitask. And yet it is important in your life to concentrate because if you focus on one thing at a time and if you do it well, you become an expert,” Narayanan told the young audience. 

“It has been shown by science time and again that those who multitask are the least efficient because human beings are not meant to be machines. They are meant to be human.”

4,2019-06-17,Nestle,"New Delhi: E-commerce giant Amazon India is the most attractive employer brand in the country followed by Microsoft India and Sony India, says a survey.

According to the Randstad Employer Brand Research (REBR) 2019, released Monday, Amazon scored high on financial health, utilisation of latest technologies and a strong reputation.

Microsoft India emerged as the runner-up, followed by Sony India.

Others in the top 10 most-attractive employer brands in India for 2019 include Mercedes-Benz at 4th position, IBM (5th), Larsen & Toubro (6th), Nestle (7th), Infosys (8th), Samsung (9th) and Dell (10th).

In line with the REBR philosophy, Google India had been inducted into the Hall of Fame category last year, for winning the coveted title for three consecutive years.

The Randstad Employer Brand Research, covered 75 per cent of the global economy with 32 participating countries and more than 2,00,000 respondents worldwide.

The top driver for the Indian workforce while choosing an employer are salary and employee benefits, followed by work-life balance and job security.

""Employer branding has emerged as a crucial positioning tool for both companies seeking talent with must-have skills and candidates seeking organisations that can support their aspirations of realising a meaningful career,"" said Paul Dupuis, MD and CEO Randstad India.

The survey further noted that a vast majority (55 per cent) of Indians prefer to work for a large multi-national corporation, while a negligible 9 per cent preferred start-ups.

The preference for multi-national companies (MNCs) can be strongly attributed to job security, financial health and career progression opportunities that these organisations are able to offer their employees.

The survey also noted that the Indian workforce prefers to work for companies operating in sectors like IT, ITeS and Telecom (67 per cent), Retail, FMCG and E-commerce (67 per cent), followed by Automotive (66 per cent) and BFSI (65 per cent)."
5,2019-06-20,Nestle,"TORONTO: Children who are inattentive in kindergarten are more likely to report lower incomes than their peers at the age of 33 to 35 years of age, a study has found. On the other hand, the most ""pro-social"" boys - who help others, are considerate and willing to participate in educational projects - are overwhelmingly headed for careers that pay more than the average, according to researchers from Universite de Montreal in Canada. 

""Over a 25-year career, the differences between the two groups can reach USD 77,000,"" said Sylvana Cote, lead author of the study published in the Journal of American Medical Association (JAMA) Psychiatry. 

""And all this has nothing to do with intelligence or IQ because extreme cases have been excluded from the sampling,"" she said. 

""The differences are significant between the groups studied, but the precise reasons for these disparities are still difficult to identify,"" said Cote, who specialises in child development. 

Problems of inattention more often lead to kids dropping out of school or having trouble adjusting as they enter the labour market.

On the other hand, the researchers found, ""prosocial"" children are on a trajectory that leads to better-paying jobs. 

Researchers used data from over 3,000 kids who were in kindergarten in 1985. Behaviours were evaluated over time through questionnaires. 

This is the first time that ""pro-sociality"" has been studied in a survey of this kind -- and its positive effect came as a surprise to the team. 

""We expected to find differences between boys and girls and we did find some important ones,"" said Cote. 

""We expected hyperactivity to be the most important variable, but in fact it turned out to be less important than simple lack of attention,"" she said. 

Differences were evident when data was crunched for in 2015, a year when the grow-ups were in the prime of their working lives and when the wage gaps between individuals were stark.

The researchers said that childhood inattention is associated with a wide range of long-term adverse outcomes, including lower earnings over the course of a career. 

They add that early follow-up and care for very inattentive children and boys who rarely express prosocial behaviours ""could result in long-term socio-economic benefits for individuals and society."" 

The researchers also found that women earn only 70 per cent of what men earn. 

""This result underlines that the origins of gender disparities in childhood are poorly understood and deserve to be studied,"" said Cote.

8,2019-06-21,Nestle,"NEW DELHI: Good image is fetching a premium in Indian stock market this season.

As Dalal Street struggles to separate the chaff from the grains amid widespread corporate governance issues and crippling rating downgrades at reputed corporate groups, MNC firms and some small foreign promoter-backed stocks are seeing an extended good run. A few of them have rallied as much as 74 per cent year to date.

MNCs and foreign promoter-backed firms are traditionally known for strong parentage, technological proficiency and asset-light business models. They are usually well-capitalised, have low debt exposures and good dividend policies. 

While half the NBFCs are down in the dumps amid debt and liquidity challenges, foreign promoter-backed players Aavas Financiers (up 72 per cent) and CreditAccess Grameen (up 52 per cent) have kept on rallying to be counted among the best performers of the market this year.

Aavas Financiers is backed by private equity players Lake District and Partners Group, while CreditAccess is promoted by Netherlands-based CreditAccess Asia.

Shares of Black Rose Industries, where foreign ownership stood at 74.5 per cent as of March 31, are up 41 per cent year to date. This company deals in chemicals, textiles and owns India’s first acrylamide manufacturing plant.

Among other foreign promoter-backed companies, Hexaware Technologies, Xchanging Solutions and Sobha are all having a dream run on the bourses.

Among Indian arms of MNCs, Astrazeneca Pharma is up 31 per cent this year. Huhtamaki PPL, Procter & Gamble Health, Bata India, Heidelberg Cement India and Siemens have gained 20-30 per cent. Others such as Esab India, ABB India, Timken India, Honeywell Automation India, Abbott India and Pfizer are up 10-17 per cent. This compares with a 5-7 per cent slump in BSE Midcap and the BSE Smallcap indices during the same period.

Many of these stocks have delivered multibagger returns in last three years, while the later half of this period was quite a harsh for the broader market.

“MNC stocks, including those in consumer and NBFC segments, have been seeing a rerating over the past 2-3 years even though many of them were neither seeing either strong volume or earnings growth. If you map price multiples to actual earnings growth, you will see many MNCs got much better rerating of price multiples despite having slower earnings growth,” said Raunak Onkar, Head of Research at PPFAS.

While Aavas and CreditAccess are recent debutants, shares of Black Rose Industries have risen 244 per cent in last three years, 1,075 per cent in five and 2,950 per cent in last 10 years. Astrazeneca has doubled investor wealth in last two years, having risen 73 per cent in three years. 

In all, 14 of the 139-odd BSE-listed MNCs have delivered 100-500 per cent returns in three years. As many as 36 stocks have rallied over 50 per cent during the period.


Not-so-transparent
Onkar said MNCs might have lesser corporate governance issues, but they are not as transparent as perceived.

“Most MNCs do not even hold conference calls or analyst meetings. They only have AGMs. Analysts can’t access the managements. Very few of them offer public disclosures with quality that matches those of their domestic counterparts. But somehow the market believes these companies are better governed than their local counterparts,” he said. 


Consistent performers, high on valuations
Deepak Jasani of HDFC Securities said brand and technology leaders in consumer staples, discretionary, chemicals and industrials have consistently outperformed within the MNC space. These benefits, he said, have translated into high RoE, low leverage and better asset turnover. 

That said, high valuations and slowdown in earnings growth have hit quite a few stocks. 

To name a few, largecap MNC stocks such as Hindustan Unilever (flat), Maruti Suzuki (down 14 per cent), Nestle India (up 5 per cent), Britannia Industries (down 8 per cent), Vedanta (down 17 per cent) and Bosch (down 17 per cent) have taken a hit in recent times. 

Jasani said while none of the MNCs are available at cheap or fair valuations, one should watch this space for sudden selloffs which is when they would offer good entry points.


Top picks
Antique Stock Broking prefers stocks that rank high on quality quotient, have made FY19- 21 earnings growth projections in the upwards of 15 per cent and command reasonable valuations on the bourses.

“Among the 15 largecap MNC stocks we cover, staples rank high on quality parameter. Industrials are another set of stocks which meet all parameters given the likely recovery in investment cycle. Stocks that meet all the three parameters include HUL, Nestle India, Bosch, Colgate, Siemens, ABB India, P&G Hygiene, Gillette India, Honeywell Automation, Glaxosmithkline Pharma and Cummins,” the brokerage said.

In the midcap space, Antique likes Bata, Whirlpool, Abbott India, Pfizer, Wabco India, SKF India and Thomas Cook. Grindwell Norton, Timken India, Johnson Controls, Linde, Federal Mogul, GE T&D, ICRA and Kennametal are smallcap MNCs the brokerage is positive on."

6,2019-06-21,Nestle,"BENGALURU: ITC has test launched an instant coffee brand that will directly compete with Hindustan Unilever’s Bru and Nestle’s Nescafe in the Rs 1,500-crore market.

The new product, Sunbean Beaten Caffe – a ready to use beaten coffee paste – is being launched in Delhi NCR initially before its national rollout.

“Sunbean Beaten Caffe is an innovation that has been powered by a deep understanding of coffee consumption habits of Indian consumers and thereby converting the insights gathered into a breakthrough product,” said Hemant Malik, divisional chief executive, foods division, at ITC.

The Kolkata-based cigarette-to-cookie maker had launched roasted and ground coffee powder under the Sunbean brand three years ago, but sold it only through its hotel properties. So, the new brand launch marks its retail entry in the instant coffee market.

The launch is part of ITC’s strategy to boost packaged foods business that drives bulk of its new launches and currently accounts for 21.3% of its overall revenue.

The company’s first-to-market offers, distinctive products and efficient supply chain and distribution network will help it gain share in the multinational dominated segment, analysts said. HUL and Nestle together control nearly the entire market for coffee in India, largely a tea drinking nation, with their instant powder coffee brands such as Nescafe and Bru. “Innovation in fast moving consumer goods segment is difficult,” said Abneesh Roy, senior vice president at Edelweiss Securities.

“From a product perspective, instant coffee in paste form is new, which gives ITC a competitive edge. However, taste, application and pricing will be critical factors.”

Sunbean Beaten Caffe is priced at Rs 130 for 125 grams, lower than Bru, which has a price tag of Rs 175 for 100 grams, and Nescafe that costs Rs 254 for 100 gm. ITC’s packaged food business grew 12% in the year ended March to Rs 9,668.72 crore. It is the third-largest listed packaged foods company in the country.

In foods, ITC is the market leader in packaged atta and premium cream biscuits. It is the second largest in instant noodles and the third in packaged juice.

Aashirvaad is its largest food brand, with more than Rs 4,500 crore in retail sales, followed by Sunfeast at more than Rs 3,800 crore and Bingo at over Rs 2,500 crore. Last fiscal, ITC launched about 50 new products and variants in the consumer goods space, mostly in packaged foods segment that saw nearly three dozen new introductions across segments including dairy, juice and chocolates."

11,2019-06-29,Nestle,"It is difficult to get consent of minority shareholders as many a time they are scattered, un-participative, no interested and at times they do not even know too much of what is happening, says Harish Bijoor, brand expert & CEO, Harish Bijoor Consults. Excerpts of interview with ETNOW.

The Securities & Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has said that they will be rolling out a cap on royalty payments at 2% of the net sales. Which are the companies which will be most impacted because several big companies like Maruti, Hitachi, General Electric are used to this exercise. I believe this is going to be a positive for a lot of the bigger ones and we are really talking in terms of HUL, Procter & Gamble, possibly Maruti because fundamentally we are talking about very responsible companies. The Sebi regulation was meant to avoid the abuse of third party transactions and typically among the big companies that does not exist.

Then there was a fear at a point of time about minority shareholders who are scattered, and are non-participative at times and not interested even at times. This is a good move and it does not benefit anyone too much, but at least in terms of regulation, there is a levy.


You have been tracking these brands for a long time. What would have a Unilever been without the royalty payments, without the technology support, without the investments that they do in the brands globally? Similarly, what would a Nestle have done without the global brand investing into the local arm heavily?Absolutely. Bbrands are a function of two things. One is the equity that they bring to the party. Brand equity is quite an intangible asset but it belongs to someone and we live in the day and era of IP and we respect intellectual property rights. 

It is only right that brand royalty is paid on basis of what happens to the brand in the country which is actually using it. Second is technology and the tech fee. It is again is very important not only for companies like Unilever or but also certainly for companies in auto. 

For instance, there are a lot of auto companies who tend to use it. These companies without the technology interference or without the brand royalty, would be shells where one would need to invest from the scratch. So, there is an appreciation in this regulation which says that a brand is function of kind of equity and technology that is brought into the country.


It is not that they are only paying the royalty, MNCs do a lot of investments as well before they launch those technologies. So, it is not that they are paying for using the brand, it is also a lot of new technology that they get from the parent.Yes, rightly so because any piece of technology that you use has taken a lot of research and development in terms of putting it together and you are getting it back out here in our country on a platter. But at the end of that meal comes a bill as well which needs to be settled. That bill is this transaction which we are talking about.


 They are saying that you need a shareholder nod beyond a point for companies. Shareholders in bigger companies, which have time and again benefitted from the brand and technology, be more than happy to get this approval in most cases?Mostly yes. But if it was only the approval of the entire set of shareholders that would be the easiest thing to do because you get a nod and believe it or not, most of the time the majority shareholder is the one which would give the nod easily with one stroke of pen."

3,2019-07-10,Nestle,"With a $7-billion digital slice, 21x valuations, you should buy TCS on dip, buy the little softness in the reporting, says Dipen Sheth, Head, Institutional research, HDFC Securities. Excerpts from interview with ETNOW.

Let us talk about IndiGo first. Yes, there are corporate governance issues, long drawn out battle, the impact on the stock regardless of the fact that it is a company that has great valuations, doing well and has had no complaints till now. How would you digest this news?We will be watching this space closely. Any kind of spat at the ownership or sponsor or promoter level is a problem. God knows MindTree is going through some such thing right now. Internal management quality is wonderful. The quality of the business is beyond question. But there is an ownership issue and who is really going to drive this ship is the question. The sena (army) is good but if I am not sure about the senapati (General), then I do not know what this army is going to do. 

Somewhere down the line, both realised that they will destroy value if the spat continues. I hate to take sides here or suggest a way out. It is not my mandate of brief but if one of the litigants withdraws respectfully and decides to let the value remain intact and maybe agree to encash the value, it may be solved. I do not know which one it should be and there are various schools of thought around that. Frankly we need to get into the details. But anything that disturbs the mood of two senapatis will rattle the sena. That is the fear we have in MindTree, that is the fear we should have in IndiGo and we should wait for the news bites to die down and for them to put their heads together and work a way out.


Aviation is becoming so interesting because we have seen what has happened with Jet. At Air India, they are talking divestment but anyway let us keep that aside for the moment. There is the growth potential.There is SpiceJet, another wonderful management, let us not forget Ajay Singh.


Yes so then, it is the only beneficiary in this game?It is not that your loss is my gain, first of all. It played out that way with Jet because in that case, there were horrible operating cost structures and they were overleveraged and there were reckless expansions, coupled with some well founded concerns on corporate governance. 

 I do not think we have a similar problem in say SpiceJet at all. In fact, I see a money spinner in IndiGo and I am willing to go out on a limb and say Air India’s franchise, its slot, its multi-location advantage across India and the world, makes it a great case for divestment and efficient management which it is not right now. 


The sector needs to grow, if there is so much untapped potential….It is not about the growth needs of the sector, the bigger deal is that the sector can grow. This is one of those sectors for India from a five or ten-year perspective where anywhere between 5% and 15% volume growth every year is feasible. Something like a 10% to 12% volume CAGR is easily achievable for a decade.


After the strong performance in Q4, TCS has started off on a fairly slow pitch. How have you read into the numbers and experts are saying that there are going to be more headwinds for the stock ahead? You can tick all the negative boxes if you are pessimist on TCS. The US has had a great three-year run on micros. TCS has had an even better run if you look at it that way. It is now a $20-plus billion company. You are looking at hopefully India’s currency not continuously depreciating in the foreseeable future although the jury is out on that. You are looking at digital disruption hitting the sector continuously over the last two years and a lot of people getting it and not getting it and all that kind of thing. 

If that is the lens you want to look at TCS through and of course the upcoming talent crunch and shortage for onsite talent in the US, you can keep finding gaps and the fact that TCS continues to be a services play rather than a product play like the glam dogs in the innovation space within IT. However, you got a $20-billion pure services company with an interesting layer of consulting which is highly respected in the US. When we travelled through the US less than a year ago and spoke with stakeholders across the industry value chain -- customers or competitors, consultants, global innovators companies and so on -- there was uniform respect for the management quality and the delivery efficiency and the reliability of TCS. 

Within India’s software space, TCS is the Mercedes Benz of delivery. I do not see that changing. Now they have got a $7-billion digital practice as well. Yes legacy has slowed down and in fact it is just about flat year on year and you will crib about the headline growth not being 3% and 2 point something, the margin slipping from the 26% band to somewhere around 24% and all of that, but with a $7-billion digital slice, 21x valuations, you should buy the dip, you should buy the little softness in the reporting. 


It is just around the Rs 2100 mark...Yes so who is selling? Nobody. You can crib all you want on TCS but a great company with slightly higher or little higher than industry valuations is not to be sold. There is no sign that the greatness is going away. Once you see greatness going away, you may not want to give a premium valuations. It has played out in Eicher. It has played out in Page. But it is not playing out for TCS because they continue to deliver within a certain range. It will always be a half or a one per cent up or below what you think it should have been, but there is no breakdown of the thesis at all.


 Is it playing out for Bajaj Finance?There is a contradictory thing coming through. First of all, the disclaimer that we do not have them under coverage and we have been trying to figure them out and this is a company that ticks all the boxes just like TCS and while we do not have them under coverage, and we do not have a formal recommendation. There is nothing to my mind which suggests that a little bit of caution reported by Mr Bajaj should be taken as a five-year commentary. He will go through ups and downs, the business will go through ups and downs but look at that growth and look at the sustainability of that growth and look at that growth coming without spoiling the quality of the balance sheet.


 Well there is a thought that came in from one of our other market participants saying that the risk of default would filter down to small ticket loans also. Yes of course, so they just do not want expectations to run ahead of reality and if you have smaller ticket size loan, remember the risk is granular and mostly manageable there out of process rather than solid person to person underwriting skills, the thing that happens in a Rs 500-crore corporate loan. The kind of risk management skills needed there are completely different from the risk management skills which are needed in a Rs 10,000 mobile loan. 

The Rs 10,000 mobile loan can actually be automated and be powered with artificial intelligence and risk analytics in a way that the Rs 500-crore corporate loan cannot be. I am much more bullish on the prospects for Bajaj Finance than on the prospects for many of the corporate banks which are now healing very fast.


Financials is really what everyone is betting on in terms of a certain segment within the broader pack, hoping that some of the monetary stimulus will start to kick in, that the cleanup is behind us. Would you agree or would you still be a little cautious?No at one-third or so of the lead index, financial is where you must be focussing very closely but as this market has taught us for the last few years, it is not going to be broad- based move and you will see divergence in performance, you will see divergence in valuations and you will be puzzled to see even more divergence in their commentary and in the way the stock eventually performs. You will continue to be puzzled by the relative outperformance of what is good but you feel it is too costly and that has played out for Bajaj Finance. 

It will continue to play out for some of the bigger banks and it is time that Axis and ICICI Bank got back to their old premium valuations. Axis has many more miles to cover on the valuation front although some brokers have recently said that is the big valuation re-rating game ever. There are many levers at Axis and of course at ICICI Bank. Whether it is growth, balance sheet healing, sharpening of core metric as you move forward, Axis after the big blowout on asset quality has got less than 2% of their loan book to BB and below quality. We see even here for the next two years, provisioning or credit costs falling appreciably over the next two-three years. , Now you have an inspirational leader in charge who is being able to attract talent from HDFC Bank and that is inspiring as an observer.


What about an IndusInd?IndusInd is a very interesting case. There is no question on management quality there. They have had that accident with IL&FS but they have been running a brilliant operation for more than a decade now. They are reasonably valued. This is a very good opportunity to look at IndusInd all over again because with by adding the Bharat Financial slice to their loan book one, gives them diversification and a ROA higher than their average ROA kind of loan book with relatively lower consumption of capital. 

Are they buying more risk? I think they are getting more opportunity. There are two ways again to look at this, they are getting far more reach into up-country India. The opportunity for eventual cross-sell may not be there right now, but eventual cross-sell of a whole lot of financial products down that channel is tremendous. They have been punished God knows enough for their accidents with IL&FS and as they transitioned to Ind-AS, some of their bloated fee income reporting might get a little averaged out, but I wouldn’t be worried on that. 

The big deal here is can they keep a tight grip here on the slight shake up that has happened in asset quality and Bharat Financial can continue to deliver on what is clearly a very high opportunity lending slice, lending vertical in microfinance. I suspect there is going to be serious value creation all over again in IndusInd Bank.


 What is the view on FMCG space? Do you believe this is an opportunity to enter, is there more pain?It is fashionable to beat FMCG saying that oh! valuations are at 40, 45, 50 and all of that. Rural India is going through a slowdown so FMCG will underperform. God knows it has not underperformed in the last five or 50 years, so long as we remain the broader comment on FMCG so long as we remain a consumption up skilling driven economy any consumer business is set for a good time that said some consumer businesses have more cyclicality or vulnerability. Let us say so a business like Symphony. I am going outside FMCG to illustrate my point. A business like Symphony has more vulnerability to reported weather, a business like Voltas has more vulnerability to consumer sentiment because after all it is discretionary spend. 

On FMCG the big deal is that you need to look at quality of portfolio. Hindustan Lever stands out as there is just no comparison with Hindustan Lever and Nestle, though we do not have Nestle under coverage. These two companies completely stand out but and niche stories like Marico, the vulnerability on Marico has been that they have not had a single a very large product success or brand success for sometime, but they are a very gifted management and the advantage that they got over the last 6 to 12 months was the gradual falling off of the copra price cycle which they play to advantage and delivered alpha for investors.

I do not think we should look at it purely from a copra cycle perspective either. You do have high quality businesses. I must confess like Marico, like Britannia and Lever, you have to take your pick in terms of where you find the valuations comforting. 

I must confess that ITC at 40-45% discount to the sector is alluring even though it is a sin industry and the stock has gone nowhere. 

If I can round up my views on the entire consumer space and not just FMCG, I must confess that despite the headline high valuations, I also like Jubilant Foodworks for the sheer management quality and the reinvention of the business model over the last year and a half or so. Much of that is still to deliver, especially in terms of their digital evolution and you have no idea what you can do. They are a food tech company and a consumer company combined into one and you have no idea of the addressable opportunity that they are looking at, the kind of levers they are pulling in terms of internal efficiencies getting revamped and getting driven by digitalisation. The 37-38x kind of valuation multiples are not too scary. The stock has gone nowhere over the last few months and this is a good time to pick it up.


What are you making of the higher tax on FPIs? In your notes you have said that it may not be a bad thing?That is again a slightly higher level comment. I have always been personally uncomfortable about the fact that I can invest in my markets at a tax rate which is different from foreigners level playing field. Mutual funds are not taxed for the simple reason that they are pass through instruments. As an investor in a mutual fund, I am liable to pay short term or long term whatever the case might be. Long-term capital gains of 10% may be regressive but it is not significant enough to kill the sentiment for investing. Long-term investment in the stock market should be incentivised. Given the very low penetration that equities have in our household savings pie, may be the thing to do is perhaps to take up the holding period to two years or even three! Why not and say we will tax you at zero rates for that. This is one suggestion I have for the government. 

The second thing is on the FPI bit. I want simplification and I want FPIs to be treated the same way as let us say Indian corporates would be treated if they were to invest in the stock markets and in fact FPI should be treated at par with mutual funds in so far as that if mutual funds are pass through instruments, the eventual beneficiaries of FPI holdings. If you cannot pass through the tax impact, then you need to tax them as and when they book those profits in the stock market and I am okay with that. 

I do not think there is much to crib there. Having said that, overall on taxation front, the budget has been a little harsher than it could have been and I am not complaining about the 42 or 43% effective on the higher tax slabs. A lot of the rich folks will crib on that I think it is okay, I do not think it is a big deal. For me the bigger deal is the taxability, getting more people in the tax net. The good work that was started by Aadhaar by digitalising or digitising the IT or Income Tax.

Digitising IT infrastructure was a good idea, Aadhaar was a good idea and the DeMon was a good idea in terms of trying to get more people in the tax net, putting up withholding tax on large cash withdrawals is a good idea. But there are a whole lot of people who are still outside the tax net and who are taxable. I wish the government would do something tight and something strong to get them into the tax net maybe then we can let go of the 45% or 43% tax rates."
4,2019-07-23,Nestle,"A year hence we will be in that position where we can look back at 2018 and 2019 and say 'thank God, we cleansed out the worst of the excesses in the financial sector', says Saurabh Mukherjea, Founder & Chief Investment Officer, Marcellus Investment. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

Are we in a spot of bother because FIIs have started selling? Domestic institutional investors do not have too much left in the fuel tank, and HNI and retail investors already have a big hole in their tanks.I suppose the way to think about it is that domestic flows dried up around February-March, so March-April-May the market ran up on FII money. Obviously the election results and the NDA’s emphatic mandate was greeted by even more FII money. But courtesy the tax announcements on 5th July, that FII money has also dried up. As a result, what we are seeing over the last three-four days is lots of downward pressure. Something will have to give. Either the government re-visits the thinking that has been applied to the taxation construct for FPIs or FPIs pull out more money and we see more downward pressure on the market. 

But on one level it is as simple as that -- domestic money dried up around spring. The FIIs pushed Sensex towards 40,000, but now the FIIs have pulled out and we are heading towards 35,000.


 What is the right way to approach the market? Just wait for all the dust to settle down and then take a look at what you could buy on a decline because some of the cream names have begun to fall as well -- the HDFC twins, the Bajaj twins, etc?It is worth drawing a distinction between the two types of stocks that are correcting. One group of stocks correcting was warranted a long time ago -- in some cases several years ago. Finally we are seeing those companies pull back. A lot of NBFCs and HFCs had rallied through 2017, 2018 and these stocks are obviously down 70-80%. As I said before, a lot of these guys will not survive. We are in half way through a consolidation in the NBFC and HFC sector. Even amongst the private sector banks we will see more pain. I do not think we are done with private sector banks' pain yet. This notion that the NPA cycle has peaked is a bit of a fantasy, I reckon. That is one element, what I would call a healthy correction. 


 Where this correction offers really juicy opportunities is, as you were mentioning, in high-quality compounders like a Bajaj Finance or HDFC Bank pullback. It obviously creates beautiful openings to buy consistent compounders/class franchises at decent valuations. That is something we are very keen on. We discussed the merits of buying top-quality companies and sitting patiently before, and that is what we continue to advocate. We have Bajaj Finance and HDFC Bank in our portfolios. I also own them personally, but the pullback there actually makes us quite happy. It gives us a chance to buy great names at better prices.


In your last newsletter, you have done a great comparison between HUL and Nestle saying that classic great compounders were expensive 20 years ago and this time also, it is no different. What falls in that bracket which optically looks expensive for a purist who looks at valuations and may not be excited to own them, but in hindsight may consider it a mistake?I will quickly just explain what I think happens in the market. A lot of people believe that HUL, Nestle, Asian Paints and HDFC Bank are all series companies. They see them as similar to blue chips but actually they are not. In that newsletter we explained why a stock like HUL is simply not in the league of an Asian Paints, a Nestle, or even a Marico when it comes to consistent compounding. 

Asian Paints, Nestle, Marico have track records of consistently growing revenues year after year, decade after decade, in double digits with ROCs consistently ahead of 15%. There are around 20-odd companies in our country which fall in this bracket where revenues are double digits year after year. It does not matter whether it is Lehman or the dot-com bust, these companies are able to grind out outstanding results. Now the point we have emphasised to our clients over the last 12 months is that with franchises of this calibre -- Asian Paints, Nestle, Marico, Kotak Bank, HDFC Bank -- you really should not be using PE multiples and PB multiples to ascertain their fair value. It does not work. You have to look at their ability to generate outstanding results over long periods of time and therefore buy them even at current valuations. I was saying this even last week before the correction. 

Buy even at current valuations, it is better to sit tight and let them deliver results for you and grow your wealth. This notion that you can look at a PE multiple and figure out whether the stock is cheap or not does not work for these elite franchises. But I do concede that there are probably no more than 20 such companies in our country and these are the sort of stocks that we have in our portfolios. I own them personally, so in that regard I am talking my own book.


We had some commentary from the RBI governor talking about how some of the rate cuts so far have been fair and that he feels they are enough to get the system going. Going forward, do you see a turnaround or a potential for growth kicking in? I know you are really positive on financials, but how would you factor in that commentary from the central bank?I will make three points here. Firstly, Shaktikanta Das deserves a fair bit of credit. From the time he took charge, he recognised the extent of the challenges the NBFC sector has faced, he consistently pumped liquidity into the system month after month and he cut rates consistently as well. 

Secondly, I do believe that the RBI still has enormous ability and I reckon they are applying their minds, but they can do more to arrest this NBFC crisis. It is not a question of cutting CRR and SLR. It is a common notion that RBI's cutting of CRR, SLR or the repo rate will help. It is not that easy. We need the central bank to step in and arrest the crisis of confidence in the balance sheets of listed NBFCs and HFCs. 

The bond market, the CP market and the money market simply do not believe these balance sheets anymore. The credibility of credit rating agencies is obviously dented given what has happened in the last couple of years. What we need the RBI to do is to step in and say 'We are going to examine these balance sheets'. Basically do what was called QR for the banks and we will certify the quality of the balance sheets. If recapitalisation is required, we will say as much. What that will do is at least tell the money market and bond market which NBFC's paper is worth buying and what NBFCs are best avoided. At the moment it is almost a generalised drift to oblivion for the entire sector, which is not good for the sector or for the country. We need the central to step in and inject confidence in the sector. 

The third point is that we will see a decisive intervention from the authorities over the next couple of months. There is a great deal of work going on and we will see an intervention which will lead to the best stocks in private banks and NBFCs rallying quite decisively on the back of the policy intervention. 


With an overhang like Dewan Housing, Essel Group or the Zee promoter leverage problem, what will happen to their exposure to banks? If these issues get sorted out, could that re-rate some of these NBFCs and beaten-down banks?We need a combination of fresh equity coming in. We need fresh equity coming into all of these structures because these are overly-leveraged stocks with too much debt and too little equity. In some of these structures, we also need better governance. So, it is a combination of the two. It is not just money, we also need the CP and CD market to see credible people who can provide credible governance, rather than many of these familiar characters who have been a part of our market landscape over the last decade or so. 

From the looks of it, there is enough interest in India that was in the States last week meeting pension funds and endowment funds. There is enough interest overseas for that sort of money to come into our country. In the next six months we will see plenty of ownership changes, fresh money and fresh governance. That should lead to the beginnings of a recovery. I reckon Shakti Das will keep liquidity plentiful in the system, the 10-year bond yield goes down. That is probably the beginnings of the revival in our financial system.


Give me a list of your classic compounders. We know Asian Paints, HDFC Bank, TCS. Anything else which you have added that according to you has the potential to be an earnings compounder?We have not discussed one company in as much detail in public before. But since you are prompting me, I will take the opportunity to mention Dr Lal Path Labs. Whatever we said about the economic downturn and the auto downturn, people in our country will continue needing Path lab tests as they are essential in life. In northern and eastern India, Dr Lal Path Labs is the largest player. Westward, Metropolis gives Dr Lal a run for its money. But in northern and eastern India -- the largest markets in the country -- DLPL is the dominant player. Its track record over the last six-eight years of growing the business, with ROCs approaching 30-35% and earnings compounding north of 25%, has been quite spectacular. In a sector where the informal-to-formal shift is already happening, the neighbourhood path lab is gradually getting crushed and Dr Lal Path Lab has a spectacular ability to compound the businesses without needing fresh infusions of capital. 

I do not think the stock has done that much since the IPO a couple of years back, so you cannot give the standard argument of that being expensive, etc. But I do not think is as applicable here. We have been buying it steadily over the last year or so and we remain biased to this day. We have it in our client’s portfolios and I own it myself.


 I know you are looking at it from a long-term perspective, but give me a sense of what we can anticipate in six months or a year? Are we going to see more pain? When do you see things turning around or is it too soon to tell? We are all human beings and we tend to exaggerate the current difficulties or opportunities and extrapolate them. There is a good chance that a year hence when we are talking on your show, we will not even be thinking about the NBFC and HFC crisis. We will be focussing on the opportunities ahead. It is worth putting the current crisis in perspective and not get too carried away or obsess over it. 

Instead focus on the fact that this country has grown for the last 20 years and will grow for the next 20. There have been great compounders who have generated 10x in the last 10 years, 100x in the last 20 years, and they will carry on doing so. If we just pullback from the day-to-day drama around the NBFC, HFC and private sector bank crisis and focus on the longer-term opportunity, we will all be better for it. I know it is hard to do. We all get gripped by the day-to-day drama, so I think a year hence we will be in that position where we can look back at 2018 and 2019 and say 'Well thank God, we cleansed out the worst of the excesses in the financial sector'. 

The way the financial services sector fell in the stock market from 40% to so near the 30% mark, and sectors like IT and pharma, which have historically shown great compounding, have perhaps gained some weight. We talked about TCS before and in pharma we like Divi’s Lab -- we have it in some of our clients portfolio. If you look at these stocks, they did not ride away over the last two-three years. I know TCS had a decent front, but Divi’s has had an uneven run and focussed on the long term. This country has generated wealth in the stock market before and it will do so again. Do not get too fussy about the current crisis.


The premise with which markets have worked in the past is that a promoter pledge is bad news. But I see it as a large source of capital for promoters where they can use the current business to raise capital to expand and grow other businesses. As more promoters are deciding to deleverage their balance sheets and reduce their pledges, the risk-taking capability at the promoter level is reducing. I do not know if this is good news or bad news!I am not so sure that promoters are doing this voluntarily. I reckon there is a great deal of caution on the lender's part in this whole loan-against-shares business, where you extend credit as a lender and the promoter puts sub shares as collateral. I think that industry is under pressure. You have mentioned some the more infamous cases that have taken place in the loan-against-shares industry. I would turn it on its head. What I was very intrigued by is that promoter-buyback activity is increasing and some of the counters where the buyback activity is increasing are high-quality companies. It is quite interesting to see that promoters themselves are aggressively buying back. I remember the last time this happened was in 2011-2012. 

You could argue that the rally began in 2013 August-September when the market sensed that the Modi victory was around the corner. The fact that promoter buying has increased is very interesting. I would turn it on its head and say rather than looking at the pledges reducing,it is better to focus on promoter buying activity which seems to be on the rise."
5,2019-07-25,Nestle,"NEW DELHI: Domestic equity indices extended the recent slide into sixth straight session on Thursday as July series futures & options contracts expired.

 Nestle India would soon commence construction of its ninth plant, which would generate employment to around 400 people, it said in a statement.

3,2019-08-05,Nestle,"There could be a rally of 200-300 points from here but that is it and markets could be in a range for some more time, says Rahul Shah, Associate VP, Equity Advisory Group, Motilal Oswal Financial Services. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW. Shah says Marico and ITC are his favourites at current levels.


What a bad start to the trading week.We have even slipped past the 10,800 mark. Does it seem like there is more downside left to the market?Near term, as we are near the bottom, there is a lot of pessimism on the Street and that is where a near-term bottom is to be made. Majority of the Nifty numbers are out and other than one or two stocks, most of them met Street expectations and there was no major mishaps. In last 20-21 days, a fierce selloff has happened and in the near term, the pessimism has taken much a bigger toll. There could be a rally of 200-300 points from here but that is it and markets could be in a range for some more time.


How concerned are you by both domestic and international factors? Where are we most vulnerable right now?We have a lot of domestic things to settle down. The biggest threat that people have been talking about is the way the economy is shaping and the measures the government is going to take. That is the biggest thing we have been talking about. 

This is going to be a major thing. Obviously, we have been seeing global slowdown since last couple of months and we have been talking about it and there again, the central bankers are usually in sync to revive the economy. Globally, it will be less gloomy than domestic issues. 


A spate of earnings have been announced. From a consumption point of view, what are your takeaways from Marico, ITC and Nestle?Marico was in line with the Street estimates or better than our estimates. ITC has seen a nervousness in the cigarette business and which has performed badly for the fourth quarter in a row. ITC was a dull quarter looking at and the Nestle is again slightly below estimates. If I have to summarise all three, I think there were no major disasters. 

Looking at the price correction in ITC and Nestle, the valuation has equated with the subdued results. In such markets, there is an over pessimism and the front seats are pharma and FMCG. One should consider buying FMCG at this level. My preferences are Marico and ITC at current levels.


What was your take on the ITC numbers -- both on the cigarette side as well as the FMCG business?As I discussed earlier also, my view is that cigarette numbers were below estimates, the volumes declined and this is the fourth quarter where the numbers are below estimates in cigarette business. I think FMCG was okay, better than or in line with the street estimates. ITC, going forward also if the FMCG business goes higher and the overall profitability of ITC will depend a lot on that. The numbers were definitely below estimates. So, upside in the market could be capped for it, but in comparison with other FMCG companies, it is trading at a deep discount and so valuations remain the most attractive factor for ITC.


What about Reliance? What is your view on the downgrade that came in today? We are seeing the impact on the stock as well? Do you see a bit more downside on Reliance?Post the numbers, the stock has been correcting. The numbers were at least better than what the street was estimating, marginally better than the street estimates. But near term, we are seeing an unwinding in most of the largecap stocks in terms of Nifty heavyweights. 

In Reliance, the GRM margin is the key factor to be looked at going forward. Secondly, the most important thing is how Jio’s subscription revenue goes higher and how their profitability comes up. These two challenges remain in Reliance and in the near term, I do not think anything major is going to happen in Reliance

The stock might remain here and again the valuations are reasonable so I think the downside could be very limited from the current levels.


Some experts are venturing brave buy at lower levels. Would you be doing so at this point or prefer to sit on the sidelines?A lot of pockets look attractive from the current levels. The way the markets have been behaving, there is a lot of pessimism built into it. I think we should definitely venture into it at current levels, Obviously pharma looks very attractive from the current levels and certain financial stocks also look attractive in terms of the price correction what has happened in the near term."
4,2019-08-06,Nestle,"I am relatively optimistic and in the next two months, we should be much higher from here and that should bode well for 2020, says Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive Vice President, IIFL Securities. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


Things seem to be back on track for now and positive momentum is building in a number of stocks. Also some earnings are out. Titan earnings showed just a touch of pressure. What is your take on the market sentiment and also specifically on Titan?The sentiment has been sour for both global and local reasons. But we may have been missing the woods for the trees. Oil is at $60 and below, bond yields are at four-year low and all that bodes very well for the government’s fiscal and current account. 

There will be a much needed stimulus for consumption and that is a buying opportunity. We know where the conventional weakness is, but three points will matter: one, the issue of transmission of money will be at the forefront. Second, some stimulus from the government and third, commodity prices getting so cheap will mean that inherently some industries will benefit. Three, industries which have done exceedingly well are paints, specialty chemicals and cement. All three are core in infrastructure and housing and autos and so on. 

So I think the pessimism is overdone. These companies guiding on the upside will see the much needed kicker firstly from the RBI via reduced rates and transmission of rates. I am relatively optimistic and in the next two months, we should be much higher from here and that should bode well for 2020. 


We have seen buying activity in certain pockets. Where would you jump in and buy at these levels? Would it be some of the corporate banks or would it be in midcaps?Clearly, we have been very bullish on four Cs – corporate banks, cement, construction and capex. Top it up with insurance. Insurance is a no-brainer. These stocks have been under our coverage and now they are making relatively newer highs on numbers despite the market making recent lows. So ICICI Pru, ICICI Lombard, SBI Life and HDFC Life would be four stocks. 

We also think some of the consumer discretionaries, select auto and consumer stocks could actually outperform. We have named some of the consumer stocks which have done well but we think as a contrarian play, auto is definitely looking for some stimulus and that will be a much needed shot in the arm. 

You could see relative outperformance from select passenger, two wheeler and commercial vehicle stocks in the next two to three months.


Some of these paint companies -- be it Asian Paints or even a Berger -- have done very well. Add to that, there have been sporadic upsides in earnings from Bata, Dabur as well. Within the FMCG sector, do you see opportunities to buy?Yes and you named them. So as a disclosure, Berger, Asian Paints, Tata Global, Dabur have all been some of our top picks. We continue to be overweight on them. You can add a Nestle that has been one of my top favourites when it was available for Rs 7,000. I have a target of Rs 14,000 by next year. That tells you that some of the pessimism is overdone in a lot of sectors and stocks. These 10 weeks are going to be slightly volatile.

But like I suggested earlier also, we think that 12-week SIP over here will be very beneficial once we get past the middle of October. Like I said, cement, paints, SRF (another stock under our coverage), packaging and the specialty chemical is doing extremely well.


Talking about SRF, what do you make of the speciality chemicals space? The stock is up about 16-17% on the back of numbers but what do you make of specialty chemicals as a sector?It depends on what is happening in China. We are still seeing huge benefit and margin expansion. The local logistics industry is definitely looking to do much better and so SRF, Atul, Sudarshan Chemical and Aarti are the four stocks which are under our coverage and are showing extreme strength. 

I would also be contrarian on select steel counters. Given that there will be an impetus from the government, local prices should start to see an uptick. If we see some more resolution on a weak Chinese yuan, other region steel producers can do extremely well. 


Where do you see the market from here? Do you see it maintaining these levels? My call for investors are the retail stocks. Please do not miss out this fear in the next 10 weeks. These 10 weeks will see all negatives getting priced in and you will be surprised on the upside. 

This Diwali could actually be very cheerful and I am relatively sanguine. After the 15th of October, three-four things can add on. Like we said, select consumer discretionary stocks, cement, corporate banks, capex, insurance -- buy a basket of stocks or maybe just the Nifty, Bank Nifty because that can truly outperform in the next 10 weeks and beyond. If we are correct, after the middle of October, you start to see an uptick than I can vouch for. That could be a longer term trend for at least a year to 18 months.


How do you look at the steel producers? Metals as a sector has not done well in the last few days. Would this be a buying opportunity?Correct. If I can name three stocks; it would be Hindalco, Tata Steel and JSW -- all three in metals and all extremely good value picks now. Tata Steel has a right outstanding at Rs 460 and is a partly paid share and the stock is available at Rs 400. There will be an impetus for the price to be above Rs 460 in the near future. The numbers are due tomorrow and all weakness will be played out. 

Iron ore prices have fallen and in the coming quarters, margins should get better. China weakness would be again a buying opportunity, given that demand supply will see some uptick after the monsoons locally. Also, just to add to it, the DHFL deal is a very big shot in the arm. A lot of the midcap banks which have proxy or have lent to it, should definitely see much-needed salvage there. If DHFL and Zee give a lot of comfort, then the whole sector’s and the market’s crisis of confidence should now abate. 


A couple of stocks are looking pretty good today, Bharti for example, the paint majors or even a Tech Mahindra. What is your view on Bharti?We have had a contrarian view and we thought that along with Jio, Bharti would be the best fit, given that they are in the process of reducing their debt in the South African business.

Secondly, their ARPUs have truly surprised, from an abysmal low of Rs 105, it came to Rs 129. It beat Jio’s numbers and it is telling you that data pricing is back and data volumes are growing. Both Reliance and Bharti would be standout performers. In fact, as a disclosure, we also think Reliance at these levels is giving you a very good opportunity. ARPUs are now definitely going to be on the way up, given that pricing is back. Bharti is a buy for a target of Rs 425."
5,2019-08-07,Nestle,"Good morning!

The domestic stock market on Wednesday showed early signs of a possible breakout from its consolidation range. And Nifty futures on Singapore traded 56 points lower this morning, signalling a weak start for Dalal Street.

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stocks.

Motilal Oswal has maintained buy rating on AU Small Finance Bank with a target price of Rs 760. AU Small Finance Bank is swiftly increasing its focus towards the high- yielding used vehicle segment and is capitalising under-penetrated opportunities in the MSME segment, thereby sustaining healthy growth momentum, said Motilal Oswal. The brokerage expects the bank to deliver steady 43 per cent earnings CAGR over FY19-21, aided by gradual improvement in operating leverage and margins. The stock ended up 3.4 per cent at Rs 657.75 on Tuesday.


CLSA has maintained outperform rating on Nestle India and raised target price to Rs 12,415 from Rs 11,750. Nestle’s second quarter CY19 result clearly indicates management’s rising obsession with growth, which is the key positive, said CLSA. This entailed tough decisions, reflected in the 100 bps YoY Ebitda margin decline, but management chose the difficult path, it said. CLSA has cut EPS estimate by 2-5 per cent due to a special dividend. The stock ended up 0.8 per cent at Rs 11,832.10 on Tuesday.


Jefferies has maintained buy rating on KEI Industries with a target price of Rs 675. KEI’s June quarter results came above expectations driven by both revenues and margin improvement, said Jefferies. Debt levels are stable and EHV capacity utilisation should continue to ramp up over the next 12 months as orders are finalised, said Jefferies. It said KEI is a holistic play given its exposure to capex, consumption and engineering exports. The stock ended up 8.2 per cent at Rs 445.20 on Tuesday.

Nomura has maintained buy rating on Equitas Holdings and reduced target price to Rs 150 from Rs 165. Equitas’ first quarter results were a small miss on PPOP versus estimates, led by some moderation in AUM growth impacting fees, said Nomura. Unlike Ujjivan, Equitas has better visibility on a listing of the bank via its scheme of arrangements, and management commentary indicates that the it has gotten RBI’s NOC as well, said Nomura. The stock ended up 2.8 per cent at Rs 106.70 on Tuesday.

ICICI Securities has downgraded Berger Paints (India) to hold from overweight with a target price of Rs 333. Berger Paints has reported a healthy topline growth and betterthan-expected margins in the first quarter of FY20, the brokerage said. While decorative volume growth is in-line with its peer Kansai Nerolac, it fell short of leader Asian Paints’ high double digit volume growth, said ICICI Securities. The brokerage has downgraded the stock given the recent increase n the stock price. The stock ended up 4 per cent at Rs 346.8 on Tuesday."
6,2019-08-07,Nestle,"It could be because these are low value, low ticket and more repetitive purchase items where the impact of a slowdown will probably come at the last leg and that’s why the volume growth is still holding up, says Sameer Narayan, market expert. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW. 
Avenue Supermart is going to be under focus perhaps because RK Damani is looking to sell 1% in D-Mart to meet the shareholding norms. At Rs 1,470, would you buy the stock?In certain cases, you do not buy on a pure multiple basis. You look at a franchise and you see how the business evolves and scales over the next 5-10 years. A classic example is Trent. These are franchises that you only get to buy at say certain times. Otherwise, every time somebody wants to take a significant large exposure to D-Mart, because it is such a thinly traded stock, you typically cause a very large impact. 

So, today when there is an opportunity and a large block is available because of a regulatory situation, I am sure people would want more to evaluate entry rather than look at valuation or multiples.


It is that one opportunity, do not miss it?Absolutely.


Titan saw a hit on the jewellery side even though they managed to maintain margins. Gold prices are perhaps set to go up. What is the outlook? In Titan, one needs to temper growth expectations a bit because over the last three quarters, they had done exceedingly well on both store accretion as well as jewellery growth. Now with the sentiment being where it is, today people honestly do not have too much of investible surplus. You will probably find the growth not being at the same rate at which you have had it so far. 

But that does not mean that as a franchise their brand and their customer appeal is not basically pulling in because it is essentially a play on the buying behaviour from unorganised to organised and it is still pretty much there. Plus the valuations have corrected quite a decent bit. If you get a good price of entry from these levels, for somebody who is looking at a three-four-year story, it is a good idea. Plus, the entire new generation businesses of eyewear is showing growth and watches. This quarter, there was a one- off large institutional order, but the other segments are also showing that the growth play is across the four segments they operate in.


Why are paint companies selling?It is a quasi consumption play because in India, we had the entire do it yourself (DIY) market and the fact that there was a lot of optimism on housing front, led to paint companies which are seen as very good proxies as they also give the cost advantage of a rising or falling crude. 

In case the crude markets are in a bearish phase, then the cost will completely play in your favour and then you do not need to knock down your retail prices that much. So, there was a tacit pricing power that the sector was giving investors to play on. But what happened in the bargain was that valuations reached a zone and now one is wondering if even a 20% growth could be sustained. 


Why are paint companies reporting strong volume growth? Housing, auto are facing downturn. It is the monsoon season and a feel-good factor is missing. This is a category which will only do well when you are feeling excited about things.It is easier for a household to re-do their homes rather than buy another house. I may not have the purse or the availability to go in and buy a big house but I can definitely repaint my house. That is the buyer behaviour for you and especially in tough times.

But having said that, may be, a lot of dealer inventories were sitting there. One needs to see this over in the next three quarters. If you look at FMCG or any consumer facing businesses, one should always look at the rolling 12 months’ sales because YoY may not be a very apt example.

It is quite likely that -- a) the behaviour pattern of doing up a house versus buying a new one; b) Today these companies really use technology in a big way. Earlier, getting a house painted used to be a huge task but the way, companies like Asian Paints have come up with technology solutions for the retail customers, makes it superbly convenient.

Today, from more of an unbranded category, it has become a branded one and so to that extent, multiples should go up. That is where perhaps the story is.


A 25 bps rate cut by RBI is something everyone on the Street is talking about. What would surprise the market on the upside? 25 bps is pretty much expected and it is in the price. If RBI has to do some heavy lifting to spur growth, they need to be confident about the fisc. In the first quarter of the current fiscal, you have seen a tax revenue growth is 6-6.7%. Now the expectation for the year is 25%. So, you are actually way behind the mark on that. RBI would obviously be mindful of that. What they have done as a response is they have shifted the liquidity stance from being deficit to a decent surplus. Now they are also mindful of the fact that the rains have been good over the last fortnight but they have been very heavy so it has been the special distribution is perhaps not as good as one would have liked to. 


Could Yes Bank be a contra buy? Yes Bank can survive as a franchise if they are able to raise capital. Then you are pretty much buying a private bank at a PSU valuation?The first problem is that instead of the private equity which was earlier supposed to come in and pick it up, they are going the public route way and putting it out to institutional shareholders.

To that extent, the type of investor who comes in is not what was earlier envisaged but having said that, the money is still in. In terms of provisioning and the cleanup, the management has shown enough resolve. Yes they are willing to bite the bullet and in the last two quarters, they have ensured that they have not disappointed the street on that front.

But having said that, as a valuation, today the bank is available at virtually a default kind of a book value. Having said that, the question now is whether it will survive and whether three years out, Yes Bank remain in the current form or will it get bought and whether it will get worse before it gets better. Those are the key risks. 

From a trade perspective, since there has been such a sharp correction in price, you might get a 15-20% kind of a trade, the way we saw in DHFL yesterday because these stocks are so oversold that chances are there would be some amount relief.

But having said that, for a long term investor, am I going to see a business which will probably last the next four-five years? He still needs to see a couple of more quarters to see which way this capital is being put to work and what kind of an asset the people would look for answers.


Even a Dabur, Bata, Nestle and Pidilite’s numbers have surprised. Within this slowdown, those are the companies which have been beneficiaries and they have stood out.You are right. It could be because these are low value, low ticket and more repetitive purchase items where the impact of a slowdown will probably come at the last leg. That is the reason why the volume growth is still holding up. But the moment you go down to slightly more high value, high involvement purchases like a discretionary, you see the whole impact. In another quarter, the monsoon flavour will come in and FMCG may still hold up on the volume side for maybe a couple of quarters more. 

But having said that, the moment you start seeing government putting some big moves after Kashmir resolution and step up infrastructure investment in that part of the country, you will start seeing the optimism."

9,2019-08-14,Nestle,"ET Intelligence Group: Amid a broader slowdown in consumption, Nestle India remains an exception. The maker of Maggi noodles delivered 10.5 per cent volume growth in the second quarter (9.6 per cent in first half of CY19), the highest among FMCG companies. The brand has finally crossed the volume of first half CY15, a period prior to the Maggi crisis.

Those attending the company’s annual investor meet were positive on the local unit of the Swiss foods major.

“We remain positive on the growth prospects as the company is aggressively launching new products and variants in existing brands, which would boost growth. We expect earnings growth at a CAGR of 19.7 per cent in CY18-20E led by strong sales growth,” said Sanjay Manyal, consumer analyst with ICICI Direct.

From 2.08 lakh tonnes of domestic sales in the first half of 2015, it dropped to 1.72 lakh tonnes in the first half of the following year. In first half of 2019, it crossed the 2015 volume for the first time – of 2.26 lakh tonnes.

Nestle is setting up a new Rs 700-crore Maggi plant in Gujarat. “The decision to set up a green-field unit of Maggi shows management confidence in the future growth potential of Maggi noodles,” said Amnish Agarwal of Prabhudas Lilladher.

While Maggi is doing well, the company is present in several other categories and has leadership in 85 per cent of its portfolio. It enjoys leadership position in instant noodles, pasta, infant cereals, infant formula, tea creamer, white and wafers chocolates and instant coffee categories. It is in the second position in ketchup and sauces categories. In the June quarter, Nestle had sales of Rs 2,983 crore, 11.4 per cent higher on year and a net profit of Rs 438 crore, 11 per cent higher. EBIDTA margins were at 23.3 per cent, down 70 basis points, because of higher raw material price. The company increased ad spends despite margin pressure.

Nestle India’s stock is trading at an all-time high at Rs 11,893. The stock is valued at 67.5 times its trailing earnings. As the only company withstanding a slowdown, the stock may see higher demand in the coming days."
8,2019-08-14,Nestle,"Good morning!

The domestic stock market on Wednesday showed early signs of a possible breakout from its consolidation range. And Nifty futures on Singapore traded 17.50 points higher this morning, signalling a good start for Dalal Street.

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stocks.

ICICI Securities has initiated coverage on Aster DM Healthcare with a target price of Rs 168. Aster DM Healthcare has established strong leadership position in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region and is expanding its operations well in India, said ICICI Securities. The stock is attractively valued at 7.4 times FY21 EV/EBITDA despite consistent growth, it said. The stock ended up 1.1 per cent at Rs 122.30 on Tuesday.


Jefferies has maintained buy rating on Narayana Hrudayalaya and raised target price to Rs 300 from Rs 290. The company reported strong performance in the June quarter led by a 180 bps plus margin beat, said Jefferies. The company remains the best-positioned hospital to benefit from the formalisation of large latent demand, said Jefferies. The key, though, remains execution, which has been below par for the past two years, it added. Jefferies has retained buy rating given better positioning and management focus on execution. The stock ended up 6.6 per cent at Rs 231.30 on Tuesday.


Credit Suisse has maintained underperform rating on TTK Prestige and cut target price to Rs 5,100 from Rs 6,000. The brokerage has cut FY20-21 earnings estimates by 6-9 per cent. Credit Suisse said it remains skeptical of a strong growth recovery as 

(1) the tailwinds from the government's drive for cooking gas penetration which helped pressure cooker growth is now behind,

(2) the broader consumption slowdown continues, and

(3) there is rising competition from low cost brands. The stock ended up 3.4 per cent at Rs 6,228.6 on Tuesday.

Kotak Institutional Equities has maintained reduce rating on Sun TV Network with a fair value of Rs 455, which was revised down from Rs 575. Sun’s positioning is weakening in the rapidly evolving media landscape; its undemanding valuation is not reason enough to turn constructive on a business that is not future-proof, the brokerage said. The brokerage has cut its below-consensus FY2019-21 earnings estimates by 3-5 per cent to factor lower ad growth,lower profit from IPL and higher content costs and subscription revenues. The stock ended down 5.8 per cent at Rs 422.60 on Tuesday.

CLSA has retained outperform rating on Nestle India with a target price of Rs 12,415. Nestle’s 2019 annual analyst meeting had several highlights, but the key positives were volume-led growth across segments and its continued focus on new launches backed by A&P spending, said CLSA. This is at a time when input cost pressure is high, showcasing management’s commitment to growth, said CLSA. The stock ended down 0.9 per cent at Rs 11,871.90 on Tuesday."
10,2019-08-14,Nestle,"FIIs have withdrawn around $3 billion but once they see growth, we can see them coming back also, says Arun Thukral, MD & CEO, Axis Securities. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

It is now practically the end of the earnings season. What have been the key hits and misses according to you?It has been a mixed set of earnings. Corporate banks like HDFC Bank, ICICI, IndusInd have delivered good numbers, but there has been some misses also.Among FMCG companies, HUL growth has been modest though Asian Paints, Berger Paints and Nestle numbers have been good. 

Cement companies including UltraTech have come up with good results while auto and auto ancillaries’ performance has been below par. 

Largecap IT companies like Infosys and TCS have done well and the former has actually increased guidance. However, performance of midcap IT companies like Cyient, L&T Infotech has been below par. So, overall mixed results. We had expected slightly better but going ahead, we may see slightly better returns.


Sentiment on the street really seems to have soured with the overall FPI issue. The Prime Minister himself has said he is taking cognisance of it. Would you believe the kind of selloff that we have seen from FPIs is far deeper and has more correlation with the slowdown that we are seeing in the economy as well?The slowdown has definitely affected the sentiment. FPI tax was a trigger at that point of time obviously they wanted a certain structure and the budget had some different meaning for them. They were trying but more importantly, that was only a trigger and it is a domestic slowdown a little bit and obviously the US slowdown. 

If you look at US yield curve, earlier it was only 10-year and we were saying three-month is inverted. Now, even two-years may get inverted soon. The difference is narrowing. A major concern is that if there is a recession worry, if there are other areas all over the world and if so much is parked in negative bonds, maybe that is one of the major reasons. They have withdrawn around $3 billion but once they see growth, we can see them coming back also. 

They have gone out in September-October 2018 and then they invested again. In the last one or two months, again they have withdrawn. This flip-flop will continue and once the growth is visible, they may come back again.


As an investor, what is the right approach right now? Do you buy this decline, do you hunt for names, keep the shopping list ready? What are you advising your clients to do?If you look at domestic equity or India equity story, then mid to long term, it is a great place to be in and one has to have a shopping list ready. But given the concerns, as of now, whether we talk about Hong Kong or Argentina or about the US-China trade war, the flip-flop continues. So, do a staggered purchase and keep your shopping list ready because these times whatever portfolio you build, if you already own some stocks and you have conviction, these are the times when you will find them much cheaper at 10%-20% discount.

Overall, you will benefit but there is no hurry because the consolidation phase will take place and over a period of time you will get more and more opportunities. We have seen 20% of the stocks giving 80% of the return but in 20% of the time. We have seen how Reliance has fared recently but for many years, there was no return on Reliance. So you have to stay invested, you have to keep buying at regular intervals and keep holding good stocks.


What is it that you would identify or which sectors?We are again talking about the private banks, corporate as well as retail focussed and along with that, IT is also a strong bet because we have seen that the overall global spend on IT is still unaffected and the results of the largecap IT and IT services have shown a good growth in the coming year. That is what one of the Gartner reports says.

The monsoon deficiency is more or less gone and so maybe there will be some consumption pickup. We have seen some of the results like HUL and paints. Then comes pharma. There is US business, some kind of growth -- whether you look at Aurobindo, Lupin, Cipla and even Sun Pharma. There is definitely an uptick. 

These are some of the areas and obviously then going ahead we are positive about textiles and chemicals and because if the trade war intensifies, textile will benefit because India is the largest cotton producer, These are some of the spaces where we feel buying can be done."
12,2019-08-19,Nestle,"CHENNAI: Nestle India chairman Suresh Narayanan said on Monday that despite the slowdown being witnessed across various sectors in the economy, he was positive about Nestle continuing to grow. 

“Unlike some other sectors such as auto, we don’t seen the FMCG sector going into negative territory. It (FMCG) will still grow, may be not in double digits but in high single digits,” he said.

Narayanan said while the FMCG sector was growing at 16-17% in the third quarter of 2018, it has slowed down to 10% now, and that growth expectations for the year would be 100-200 basis points less than original targets.

“Urban growth rates are not what they were before and double digit growth will be hard to achieve. There will be periods of slow growth but the consumption story in India is relatively more positive compared to many other countries,” he said.

The maker of Maggi noodles and Nescafe had delivered 10.5% volume growth in the second quarter ended June 30, 2019, bucking the overall consumption slowdown.

“Penetration levels of categories we are in are relatively lower. We still have runway for growth and we are also looking at accelerating our rural footprint. We are innovating at five times the pace than in the past and with increasing urbanisation, we are stepping up the power of innovation,” Narayanan said. Rural markets contribute 20-25% of Nestle’s sales presently.

Last month, Nielsen revised its growth forecast for the FMCG sector to 9-10% in 2019 from its previous outlook of 11-12%, citing a sharp rural slowdown, citing slowdown across all food as well as non-food categories with salty snacks, biscuits, spices, soaps and packaged tea leading the slowdown.

Narayanan said if industry gets its operational efficiencies on track and combined with renovation and innovation, it would be able to counter the economic slowdown. “We are fairly confident we will be able to bring in innovation-led volume growth. With relevant focus on advertising and marketing in difficult times, we believe some of our brands can be strengthened,” he said.

Narayanan was speaking at the relaunch of its health drink Milo in Chennai. The foods company on Monday announced the relaunch of its coco-malt beverage Milo, one of its biggest brands globally. “It is purely coincidental that this is happening in an environment where GSK Consumer and Unilever are merging. The tenor of our launch might have been different had we got Horlicks,” he said. GSK Consumer, which owns malt beverage Horlicks, was acquired by Unilever in December last year through an all-equity deal.

Narayanan added that Nestle’s e-commerce business has trebled over the past two years and now contributes 1.5% of its overall business. “While e-commerce in food retailing is not as salient as some other categories, it is still growing. We will continue to introduce products and packs specifically for e-commerce,” he said.

On prices, Narayanan said Nestle would have to selectively increase prices if commodity prices continue to rise. “If the unrelenting pressure on commodity prices such as milk and wheat continue, we will have to take up prices selectively,” he said."
11,2019-08-19,Nestle,"Chief executives of consumer product companies are increasingly grabbing opportunities to join the boards of non-competing professionally-run consumer-facing companies in search of new ideas to grow their businesses.

One recent example of this emerging trend is Suresh Narayanan, chairman and managing director at Nestle India, joining the board of Asian Paints as an independent director in March this year. Varun Berry, MD at Britannia, is on the board of Page Industries since May last year while Vivek Gambhir, MD at Godrej Consumer Products, is on the board of Metropolis Healthcare since September.

Ullas Kamath, joint managing director of Jyothy Labs, has been serving as an independent director on the board of VGuard Industries since July 2014. The earliest instance of this trend is perhaps that of Anand Kripalu, CEO of United Spirits, serving on the board of Marico from April 2007 to October 2017.

From seeking promoters as independent directors like Harsh Mariwala and Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, consumer-facing companies are now looking at boarding CEOs of non-competing FMCG peers as they have increased their hunt to get independent directors on board.

And there is no conflict of interest.

“All of us are professionals and not entrepreneurs and, therefore, not interested party in the operations,” Narayanan of Nestle said. “As professionals we can be honest on family owned companies, and not dependent on the board membership to make a living. Asian Paints is a well-governed company, so we learn from each other as large organisations. Being on part of good companies is also therefore not a professional risk,” he told ET.

Kripalu of United Spirits said it is a win-win arrangement. “Companies get CEOs to provide an independent view and add value, based on their experience. Equally, the CEO can take back useful ideas to implement in his own company,” he told ET.


Consumer goods sector is facing a lot of disruption amidst digitalisation, increased competitive intensity and advent of ecommerce. The trend is global. CEOs of some of the leading consumer-facing companies in the world sit on the boards of other listed consumer-centric companies. For instance, Tim Cook of Apple Inc is on the board of Nike since June 2016, and Alex Gorsky, CEO of Johnson & Johnson, has been on the board of IBM Inc since September 2014. Dirk Van de Put, CEO of Mondelez International, serves on the board of Keurig Dr Pepper since April last year, while David S Taylor, CEO of Procter & Gamble Co, joined the board of Delta Airlines this month.

“Every company wants to replicate the velocity of FMCG products, distribution reach, supply chain to support the reach, branding and advertising reach,” said Berry of Britannia.

“FMCG products, by definition, have to be omnipresent and who wouldn't want their brand to replicate that status?”

Incidentally, FMCG is the only sector of the Indian economy to have dominantly depicted this trend. “It may be so perhaps because FMCG talent is highly fungible because of their core focus on consumer,” said Milind Sarwate, former CFO at Marico, who is now an independent director on several boards. “So, any space, except for high technology, finds FMCG talent useful,” he said.

Elaborating on the incentive for an FMCG company CEO to be an independent director on another board, Sarwate said, “There is the exposure to another industry — typically an industry not far too removed from FMCG. This widens the cerebral horizon, encourages a different kind of strategic thinking. Being on another board in a non-executive capacity enables a better understanding of governance processes. The CEO gets a grounding in being a board member — this helps in his or her own individual career. It helps the CEO build new, active and live networks. All that the CEO learns gets ploughed back into his or her parent organisation.”"
16,2019-08-20,Nestle,"All the despondency and cleansing out process is getting through and after October, you will see a rejuvenated midcap index and midcap stocks, says Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive VP-Markets & Corporate Affairs, IIFL Securities. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


Should one just sit tight with positions even in the beleaguered mid and smallcap stocks that have had investors burning their fingers quite significantly?Correct. That is where the real beta will be generated. I have not seen such despondency and capitulation in midcaps in a long time and I have been there in the market fairly long. I think all the despondency and cleansing out process is getting through and after October, you will see a rejuvenated midcap index and midcap stocks. I do not rule out 2020 belonging just to midcaps and you could see stocks double, triple from here. I can stick my neck out. Midcaps are overdone on a lot of things and now they can only get better but keep your conviction ideas and do a SIP for the next eight weeks. I cannot control the volatility but I assure you after October you will see a very strong surge in the midcaps.


If you try and pick up a few things right now what would they be? Where do you still see steady returns going forward?I can name some stocks which we have been doing a SIP for 12 weeks and they are both large and midcaps and top of the line would be Reliance, UltraTech, IndusInd Bank, L&T, Sun Pharma, Maruti and a Mahindra & Mahindra. In the midcaps, Lupin, Ambuja Cement, Nestle and Ashok Leyland, IDFC First and LIC Housing should relatively outperform on all parameters. 

They are a mix of a lot of the beaten down sectors like auto, some of the contrarian plays like pharma and some of the sunshine sectors like cement, paints and speciality chemicals. But if you cannot more then just stay put, then this is not the time to sell. If you can prudently start to get a SIP, then do it for the next eight weeks you will be pleasantly surprised once we are through the middle of October. 


When it came to CG Power, the risk and audit committee has flagged off some concerns saying that the advances to related and unrelated parties have been understated. The company is yet to respond. How much of a concern or an overhang is this going to be?What has happened is that now even rating agencies, auditors are running out when the ship is starting to sink. So, a large part of it is already in the price. At Rs 18, you had hardly any succour on the downside. We know the promoter is overleveraged and that some of their Belgium and the European assets are up for sale. Now the slowdown in Europe may have delayed that and that could be the silver lining. 

Auditors like to keep their slates clean. As was the case with IL&FS auditors, now everyone is waking up and sounding alarm as stocks have fallen 90%. I would not comment too much on the stock. I think once they sell their assets and reduce their debt, that would be the only silver lining. How long that takes, we will know more from the management on that."
15,2019-08-20,Nestle,"What’s one of the first few things we do when we get up? Reach for our phones and check our new emails. Email is the most commonly used tool for communication and collaboration at work. In fact, a recent survey by Hiver showed that almost 50% of the employees surveyed said they spend at least an hour a day checking emails, including 16.2% employees that spend more than 4 hours on their inboxes.

More than 61% working professionals between the age of 25-32 choose to open their emails every time a new email notification appears, whereas 33% of the employees tend to check their emails every few hours.

The survey was conducted in order to gauge how effectively employees working across different organisations consume emails. Among those surveyed, about 80% are working in startups and 20% are working in corporates. The survey was conducted among 450 respondents in India. 


Clean up
Interestingly, while 60% of the employees surveyed agree with the need to clean their inbox time and again, almost 40% of the employees don't wish to clean their inboxes at all. It also showed that employees can often feel quite productive just by having cleaned out their email inbox, despite perhaps not creating any value for the organisation.


How employees check email


61% of the employees check their emails as soon as the email alert pops up
78% of employees use single email address for work
48% of employees spend about an hour checking their emails.
Only 55% of employees reply as soon as the mail is received.
0% of the respondents say that the maximum number of emails are from within their own organisation.

14,2019-08-20,Nestle,"What is the best part of working from home? Apart from the fact that you can be in your pyjamas, it is not having to leave your pet alone at home. That could be changing fast, with several corporate offices ditching the formal set up to have pet friendly spaces at work. in fact, a study by Virginia Commonwealth University found the presence of pets to be a significant stress buffer for their owners. The researchers found the benefits may extend to co-workers as well.

While global companies like Nestle and Google have had pet policies in place for a long time, young Indian companies are also encouraging their employees to bring in their furry friends to work. Among them is Ola’s office in Bengaluru, which rolled out a dog friendly initiative earlier this year.

Since then, around 30% of the staff have been getting their pet dogs to work. The company conducted an extensive survey among employees, which led them to realise that becoming a dog-friendly workplace was a popular demand. For now, the move is limited to dogs, given the large number of dog parents in the work force.


 The employees at Ola are free to bring their dog whenever they want. There is no restriction or limit on the number of dogs. The dog-parent needs to inform the admin of their respective office whenever they want to bring their dog to work, Srinivas Chunduru, Ola Group CHRO and CEO Ola Skilling says. The frequency of dogs at the workplace has increased to 2-3 days a week from once a week since the launch of the initiative.

“We believe in undertaking initiatives and policies that could bring comfort and ease of working to the dynamic, fast-paced and challenging work environment that we have. Our dog-friendly workplace initiative has seen participation from everyone, including the founders as well as many members of the senior leadership. I am an animal lover myself and it creates a great vibe and buzzing atmosphere when dogs visit our office,” Chundru said.

While this is good news for dog lovers, to ease apprehension, the admin team maintains a vaccination tracker for all registered dogs and informs dog-parents regarding the due vaccination dates.

To ensure smooth execution, owners are required to keep their dogs near their seats or work stations at all times, the company said. The dogs are always under the supervision of their owners while a dedicated housekeeping staff is in place to ensure cleanliness and safety standards are maintained when dogs visit the offices. Special pet rooms are also allotted to the dogs in case owners would like to keep them there."
13,2019-08-20,Nestle,"CHENNAI: Nestle India expects the fast-moving consumer goods market to continue growing this year because the “consumption story in India” is more positive than elsewhere, but not as fast as expected before as the economy is facing a slowdown, its chairman said.

“Unlike some other sectors such as auto, we don’t see the FMCG sector going into the negative territory. It will still grow, may be not in double digits but in high single digits,” Suresh Narayanan said on Monday.

Narayanan said while the FMCG sector was growing at 16-17% in the third quarter of 2018, it had slowed down to 10% now, and that growth expectations for the year would be one-to-two percentage points lower than the original targets.

“Urban growth rates are not what they were before and double digit growth will be hard to achieve,” he said. “There will be periods of slow growth but the consumption story in India is relatively more positive compared to many other countries.”

Last month, market research firm Nielsen revised its growth forecast for the FMCG sector to 9-10% in 2019 from its previous outlook of 11-12%, citing a sharp rural slowdown as well as weak demand across all food and non-food categories from salty snacks and biscuits to soaps and packaged tea.

Rural markets contribute 20-25% to the sales of the local unit of the Swiss food and drink processing conglomerate. The maker of Maggi noodles and Nescafe had delivered 10.5% volume growth in its second quarter ended June 30.

Narayanan said there were still market opportunities to tap for the company.

“Penetration levels of categories we are in are relatively lower. We still have runway for growth and we are also looking at accelerating our rural footprint,” he said. “We are innovating at five times the pace than in the past and with increasing urbanisation, we are stepping up the power of innovation.”

If the industry gets its operational efficiencies on track and combined with renovation and innovation, it will be able to counter the economic slowdown, Narayanan said. “We are fairly confident we will be able to bring in innovation-led volume growth. With relevant focus on advertising and marketing in difficult times, we believe some of our brands can be strengthened.”

Narayanan was speaking at the India relaunch of health drink Milo, a coco-malt beverage that is one of its biggest brands globally. “It is purely coincidental that this is happening in an environment where GSK Consumer and Unilever are merging. The tenor of our launch might have been different had we got Horlicks,” he said.

GSK Consumer, which owns malt beverage Horlicks, was acquired by Unilever in December last year. While Nestle was also rumoured to be in the race for the rival, it never admitted that on record.

Nestle’s ecommerce business has trebled over the past two years and now contributes 1.5% to the company’s overall business, Narayanan said. “While ecommerce in food retailing is not as salient as some other categories, it is still growing. We will continue to introduce products and packs specifically for ecommerce,” he said.

Nestle will have to selectively increase prices if commodity prices, such as of milk and wheat, continue to rise, Narayanan said."
19,2019-08-21,Nestle,"These are exciting times, says Suresh Narayanan, CMD, Nestle India. ""We are coming with new categories, new brands and have already launched 61 new products"". Excerpts from an interview with Abha Bakaya of ETNOW. 

You have brought Nestle India back from the brink and how? I know it is a long story, but how did you do it? How did you gain the customer's confidence?Firstly I want to say, with all humility and all sincerity, it is not me. I am part of the team. We are a 150-year-old company; 107 years old in India. But one of the things that characterises our company is that for us respect, dignity, transparency and trust are extremely important. I had the privilege of leading an organisation that had all of this. What we did was we went about our task with purpose, respect, dignity and transparency. I showed you in the staff shop the length that we go to. We put in a lot of effort to try and see that the rhetoric that we had was always truthful, positive and the greatest thing. The important feature in the comeback of Maggi from the dead was the fact that it was such a beloved brand. What we really tried to do here was engagement. That was number. 

Number two were the results of the legal case that we had in the Mumbai High Court and that really helped us because the hcourt allowed us to test these products in accredited laboratories and then come back into the game. It was that, together with a lot of help and support from partners, distributors, employees, former employees, members of the media and members of the larger environment that we dealt with that and brought the brand back. Now I know that you all choose to give me credit for it, but I must say that in all sincerity and honesty, if I am true to my conscience I can say that it was because of all the lions and I was just called upon to give the roar. That is really what got this brand back and I am delighted that after four years, I have the privilege of announcing that I will be putting up a new factory for Maggi noodles.


And is that one more investment to come in the Indian market?India is a very important market for Nestle even if you had just about 2% of turnover. But I think this market is seen as having enormous potential in terms of what Nestle can do. In fact, last year 2018 we had a list of the key markets of Nestle in the world. Nestle India was the fastest growing key market in local-currency terms. We grew at about 10.9% which is the fastest growth. So there is an enormous amount of interest in India.


Till now it has been a volume game. Now you are also looking at premium categories, deeper penetration, as well as distribution avenues. So is it a 360 degree approach that you are looking at? Or do you feel perhaps there will be one game changer whether it is a product or...Today we are operating in nine categories. In eight of those, we are market leaders. In about 85% of the portfolio of Nestle, we are already the market leaders. For us, the number one opportunity is increased penetration, followed by increased innovation. We are putting in a lot of innovation. The third thing which is happening in India is that the level of digital engagement of consumers is extremely high. So our digital engagement in terms of digital media expenditures as a company has been going up by 45% compounded annual growth in the last three-to-four years. So it is multi brand, it is across geographies. 

The old days of having a national plan and rolling it out are behind. That was my generation, but today it is all about localisation and clusterisation. It is all about finding relevance and resonance in a local context and that is what we are seeing. These are exciting times. We are coming with new categories and new brands. We have already launched 61 new products. We have applied a simple mantra. We call it 'failing to succeed and succeeding to succeed'. The fact of the matter is that not all the 60 have been successful. We have had about a 70% success rate. So failing to succeed is important. Failing to succeed is providing us the lessons for succeeding to succeed. And I think both of these are an essential part of who we are as a company. I am blessed with the fact that 70% of Nestle India are millennials. When I retire, the average age will fall by five years. We are going to have a much younger organisation, but that is the excitement."
20,2019-08-21,Nestle,"Lingering concerns over consumer demand amid a slowdown in the economy have left most of the fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) stocks in the red so far this year. But three stocks – Nestle, Marico and Glaxosmithkline Consumer Healthcare – have stood apart and hovered around their new peaks on the bourses on Wednesday.

The country’s largest biscuit maker, Parle Products, on Tuesday said it may let go of 8,000-10,000 people if the ongoing consumption slowdown persists. 

Nestle India Chairman & Managing Director Suresh Narayanan told PTI earlier that the FMCG sector is unlikely to touch double-digit growth, but will not see de-growth as witnessed by some other sectors, like auto.

Shares of Nestle and GlaxoSmithklne Consumer hit all-time highs at Rs 12,523 and Rs 8,010 on Wednesday, while Marico scaled its record high of Rs 401 on August 19.

Nestle shares advanced as much as 5 per cent on hopes that the stock may be in the reckoning for inclusion in the Nifty50 index after NSE tweaked the qualification norms on Tuesday. 

GlaxoSmithklne Consumer posted strong operating profit performance for June quarter driven by some cost-saving initiatives. 

“We are also overweight on the FMCG pack,” said Dhananjay Sinha, Head of Strategy Research and Chief Economist, IDFC Securities.

“HUL, Dabur and Marico besides electric consumer durables firm Crompton Consumers are the four stocks we have chosen to bet on,” he said in an interaction with ETNow.

Marico on August 1 reported a 21.6 per cent growth in June quarter profit at Rs 315 crore compared with Rs 250 crore in the year-on period.

Shares of other FMCG firms such as McLeod Russel, Kwality, LT Foods, Heritage Foods, Parag Milk Foods, Prabhat Dairy, Future Consumer, Bajaj Consumer Care, Tata Coffee, Godrej Consumer Products and Britannia are down 20-90 per cent so far this year.

Last month, market researcher Nielsen revised its growth forecast for the FMCG sector to 9-10 per cent for 2019 from its previous outlook of 11-12 per cent, citing a sharp rural slowdown. Nielsen said the slowdown was significant across all food as well as non-food categories, with salty snacks, biscuits, spices, soaps and packaged tea categories showing major slowdown in consumption. 

Citing Nielsen data, industry officials said growth in the FMCG sector has declined in last four quarters since July-September 2018 – both in value and volume terms – as consumers down-traded to lower-priced daily use products in urban markets while rural growth slowed."
17,2019-08-21,Nestle,"People feel that by the time the year gets done, there might be another year of the same tepid flattish growth or a decline, because you have to factor in the three important state elections coming up in the next four months, says Sameer Narayan, Market Expert. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


Buy on decline is out, sell on rally is out, sell and go away is the fashionable word am I right?As you rightly said, what has happened is that after three years of flat Nifty earnings, people thought in 2019 you will get a 20% plus earnings growth and the long awaited earnings revival will be around the corner. After the first quarter, you suddenly see that 20-25% earnings growth expectation has been slashed to 15%-18%. If you are knocking off close to 6%-8% in the first quarter itself and with the incremental clarity also not being very positive, people feel that by the time the year gets done, there might actually be another year of the same tepid flattish growth or a decline, because you have to factor in the three important state elections coming up in the next four months.

Hopefully, the thrust on government spending which was not there in the last four months, will start coming back and there will be some amount of government expenditure. Looking at the state plus centre fiscal deficits and the fact that the revenue collection has not been robust, one does not know because the options are limited. 

If that engine does not fire, honestly you could see September quarter earnings to be even worse than the June one. Today the scare is that if a market is trading at 19 times and the outlook for earnings is not that great, one really does not know then. Probably, what you said, just sell and go away is the order for the foreseeable future.


You would not start bottom fishing in autos just yet, would you?In fact, today the way to look at is that monsoon is the absolute short term trigger now versus a fortnight back. The rain news has been good and therefore there is at least some amount of uplift there. Plus last month, we saw the inventories in the system had run down significantly and this we discussed last week as well. As a result, some amount of risk taking has started in auto names because of the fact that they have corrected so significantly. Maybe a section of the market is trying to see value but will that sustain? If the August numbers do not show a good trend, then may be, despondency will set in.


Would you still be looking for value? Would you be sitting on the sidelines? If it is the heavyweights, would you be looking at the likes of banks, Reliance?The market is actually faced with the conundrum here because one section is fairly valued where people expect growth. In case of a domestic slowdown, that growth is under question and then there is a section which is completely bombed out. You are getting it at half time book but since those are global sectors, people are wondering if it is the right time to get in with the trade war scare. 

At an aggregate level, the earnings are not showing any great revival and therefore at 18-19 times, one is really wondering whether one should sit on cash and wait for better prices and points of entry. Today at 18-19 times, I need to look at either some sort of an investment demand kicking in or a job growth. Both are not as apparent or visible to the investor now. I think that is where lack of confidence shows up.


Any specific stocks you want to highlight today?It is better if one sticks to dividend yield plays or may be utilities where at least you have fixed returns and hence those may be better stocks to hide.


Britannia is down 20% and Nestle is up 12% why?It has something to do with the grammage aspect. Also, post the management changes, Britannia has gone from single digit EBITDA margin to now the mid teens. After having done that, there was a lot of agri inflation that they had to bear, the advertising spends went up and all that started hitting at a time where the general propensity to spend is low. 

When your top line is not growing and suddenly the cost starts coming under pressure, the profits that had built up that visibility, reduces markedly. This is why people do not have that kind of confidence going forward. On Nestle, on the other hand, after the entire Maggi problem, the way they cleaned out the inventory, the way they went on a complete image overhaul and the fact that now they have ensured that the brand extensions of Maggi are something that appeals across genres and it is an every time, every day snack. The rural plus urban is a good mix for Nestle as far as Maggi is concerned and that is why some of the other categories are ensuring that growth is delivered. Basically, at the end of the day, it is visibility and that’s what people are willing to pay for.


Is a trend emerging in IT and pharma?The way the rupee has been moving in the last 7-10 days, is giving rise to optimism that the global cyclical sectors might be a better place to hide in case the domestic slowdown gets elongated in the very richly valued, domestic-facing plays. These stocks have high valuations, high ownership are chances of selling pressure is also likely to be there. That is the reason why the ownership of pharma is low relative to other sectors and the falling rupee should give a fillip to the earnings there as well. 

People want to position themselves but in my mind, it is basically a high trade because even the last June quarter earnings do not give that kind of optimism and maybe there is still some pain left there. Also valuations are not cheap. Most pharma stocks are still probably around market multiples of 18-20 times. So chances of getting a great bargain there is less


The pain in Yes Bank continues and the stock is now at a fresh 52-week low. I though the exposure would stop at DHFL and Indiabulls or ADA. Now it is Cox & Kings and Crompton?Well every time you have something…


What have they done and how come nobody figured out? RBI gave them a clean chit. None of the analysts said they were not happy with the growth they were doing. India was growing at 20%-15%, Yes Bank was growing at 40% and it became the darling for everyone. Today we can blame the management. Somewhere, the whole disclosure angle comes up. That is why the auditors are being questioned because ultimately for an investor what you get is the annual report and the financial data which is certified by an auditing firm. One would assume that the checks and balances have been seen through. Now the idea is that the due diligence is not that deep down for a minority investor or for an institutional investor also because this is something that normally a PE investor does before they take big stakes in a company. So, if that is not getting played out and as far as Yes Bank is concerned, as we have maintained earlier, the real confidence will come once you have some visibility on how this capital that has been raised is actually put to use. 

If it still goes for ensuring that the capital adequacy is maintained, then that shows the growth is still not being serviced. Probably after this fundraise, the funds flow through the system will help for a couple of quarters and the second fundraise because will come as that is what the management has hinted at. That will be the real conformation that the worst is behind us.


How are you reading into this situation and for an investor and NMDC, which would come as a big shocker? Could it really be as extended and prolonged a case as some of the brokerages seem to be indicating?When it comes to the judiciary and their decision making, especially in terms of mining rise etc., it is a difficult call to take from an investing outcome perspective. What I can evaluate is that Rs 90 is a good yield play on the stock. In terms of growth, realisations, volume all moving parts are subject to an outcome of how the mining ban goes through. 

For an investor to be able to take a call especially, in the backdrop that globally you are seeing iron ore has been quite volatile because the moment the entire supply disruption squeeze has been coming back in line. The prices have normalised but at the same time the HR prices are down almost from $650 to about 540 now. The realisation is not the story as far as the metal complex goes and NMDC is anyway a domestic play. So what do I value here? The only thing is probably it is a dividend yield which is also a function that hopefully since the government revenues are under pressure, the dividend will still be paid out. That is the only yield play I get."
18,2019-08-21,Nestle,"The National Stock Exchange (NSE) on Tuesday revised the eligibility criteria for inclusion of stocks in the Nifty indices.

According to the revised rules, all equity shares that are traded (listed and traded as well as those not listed but permitted to trade on the exchange) are eligible for inclusion in the Nifty indices.

As a result, companies such as Abbott India, Bayer Cropscience, Multi Commodity Exchange of India and Nestle India – which are not listed on NSE but are traded in the permitted to trade segment – are now eligible to be a part of the Nifty indices. 

The move may aid companies like Nestle India, whose market capitalisation stands at over Rs 1.15 lakh crore on BSE, to become a part of Nifty. 

Post this revision, brokerage Edelweiss Securities expects Nestle to qualify for inclusion in the Nifty index. The scrip traded over 1 per cent higher at Rs 12,191 in morning trade on Wednesday. The brokerage expects Nifty constituent ZEEL to make way for the FMCG player's inclusion. 

Another stock Abbott India traded 0.15 per cent higher at Rs 9,000, while Bayer Cropscience and MCX were down 0.67 per cent and 0.62 per cent, respectively, at around 10.15 am (IST).

Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in, said, “Till now, NSE used to exclude this category of stocks while computing its benchmark index. With this new rule, stocks with higher market capitalisation like Nestle India, which is permitted to trade on NSE but not listed there, will have a higher chance of making it to Nifty50.”

Earlier, only those equity shares that were listed and traded on the exchange were eligible for inclusion in the Nifty indices.

NSE, however, said, ""Convertible stocks, bonds, warrants, rights, preferred stocks that provide a guaranteed fixed return and stocks under the BZ series are not eligible for inclusion in the indices.""

The BZ series includes companies that have failed to comply with listing requirements or unresolved investor complaints. “The revision shall come into effect from the forthcoming review of equity indices,” NSE said."
21,2019-08-21,Nestle,"A delay in likely stimulus measures from the government and selling in select heavyweights like Tata Motors, YES Bank, Tata Steel, L&T and ITC dragged the equity indices for the second straight session on Wednesday.

After falling over 300 points in intraday trade, the 30-share Sensex finally closed 267 points, or 0.72 per cent, down at 37,060. Nifty settled 98.30 points, or 0.89 per cent, down at 10,918. 

“No credible announcement related to stimulus package to boost the economy dented the mood on Dalal Street. The market is awaiting such a statement since Independence Day,” said G Chokkalingam, Founder, Equinomics Research and Advisory.

We walk you through the key highlights of Wednesday’s session:


Tata Motors @ 10-year lowAmid weakness in the auto sector, shares of Tata Motors slipped nearly 10 per cent to Rs 111.90, hitting their lowest level since October 2009 on subsidiary JLR’s China sales slowdown. Last week, Crisil downgraded Tata Motors’ rating by a notch to 'AA-' on weakening of outlook on the business risk profile of Jaguar Land Rover (JLR). The BSE Auto index closed 0.62 per cent down at 15,742. However, Hero MotoCorp, Maruti Suzuki and Bajaj Auto gained between 0.50 per cent and 1.80 per cent.


HDIL shares tank 20%Shares of Housing Development & Infrastructure plunged 20 per cent after the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) admitted an application filed by Bank of India to initiate insolvency proceedings against the debt-ridden realty firm. The scrip closed 19.96 per cent down at Rs 8.78.


CG Power, YES Bank fall furtherShares of CG Power and Industrial Solutions slumped 20 per cent to hit the lower circuit limit for the second day amid alleged financial irregularities in the company. YES Bank, which held a 12.79 per cent stake in CG Power as on June 30, declined 8.21 per cent to Rs 65.40. Gautam Thapar-promoted CG Power on Tuesday said an investigation by its board found major governance and financial lapses, including advances to related and unrelated parties as well as liabilities of the company and the group potentially being understated by hundreds of crores of rupees.


Coffee Day jumps 5%Shares of Coffee Day Enterprises hit upper circuit amid reports that FMCG major ITC is mulling a bid to buy a stake in the company as it seeks to diversify away from tobacco products. The scrip closed 4.97 per cent higher at Rs 72.80 on BSE.


Most active stocksWith 22.82 crore shares changing hands, YES Bank emerged as the most traded stock on NSE, followed by Vodafone Idea (number of shares traded: 8.43 crore), Tata Motors (8.35 crore), SAIL (3.76 crore) and Bank of Baroda (3.09 crore). YES Bank (Rs 1,545 crore) also finished as the most active stock in value terms. Maruti Suzuki (Rs 1,324 crore), Indiabulls Housing Finance (Rs 1,174 crore), Tata Motors (Rs 959 crore) and State Bank of India (Rs 792 crore) also featured on the table of most active stocks in value terms.


Spurt in open InterestWith a change of 32.25 per cent, Nestle India led the pack of stocks that witnessed the biggest spurt in open interest on NSE. It was followed by Havells (21.54 per cent), NMDC (16.84 per cent), Tata Power (16.75 per cent) and Tata Motors (15.77 per cent).


Stocks @ 52-week lows As many as 311 stocks, including Action Construction, Balaji Telefilms, Cox & Kings, Coal India, DB Realty, Excel Crop Care, Gallantt Metal and The Karnataka Bank, hit 52-week lows on NSE. On the other hand, Nestle India, Dr Lal Path Labs, Trent, Vishal Fabrics, Den Network and Jiya Eco-Products were among 11 stocks that hit 52-week highs.


Sectoral update: Metal index plungesThe BSE Metal index plunged nearly 3 per cent on the BSE. It was followed by Capital Goods (down 2.17 per cent), Oil & Gas (down 1.90 per cent) and Realty (down 1.75 per cent). The BSE IT index (up 0.16 per cent) stood as lone gainer among the sectoral indices.


Oberoi Realty, Capacit’e slipShares of Oberoi Realty and Capacit’e Infraprojects declined up to 2.17 per cent after reports that the income Tax (I-T) Department carried out searches for suspicious transactions, including alleged purchase from dubious entities. Capacit’e Infraprojects is Oberoi Realty group’s biggest vendor. Stock exchanges have sought a clarification on the development. 


Mid & smallcaps underperformWith over 1 per cent drop, the BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices underperformed the benchmark Sensex. In the midcap space, Tata Power tanked the most at 8.67 per cent, followed by SAIL (down 7.80 per cent), RNAM (down 7.65 per cent) and Wockhardt Pharma (down 7.14 per cent).

25,2019-08-22,Nestle,"I am not too hopeful of seeing a sustained recovery in auto numbers over the next 2-3 months, says Hemang Jani, Senior Vice President, Sharekhan. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW. 

There has been a little bit of a comeback in autos. Is this going to be durable in nature?Hard to say at this point of time because at the ground level, things are not looking great. Over the next two to three months, how the monthly numbers look would give a a better indication of that. Also, we have to see if the government has any package for the auto sector. I am not too hopeful of seeing a sustained recovery in auto numbers over the next 2-3 months.


Is this the darkest before the dawn or are we in for a long prolonged winter?The sentiment definitely has been weak and more importantly, the impression one is getting is that the earnings revival is not going to happen very soon, at least within the next quarter. People are not sounding too positive on that and because of that, even when you look at the stock prices and valuations on a longer term basis, you are tempted to buy but because you have gone through such a long grind and you do not see any visibility on the earnings front, it puts you on the back foot. We should take a balanced view. Expect more weakness and weak sentiment before we see a big turnaround. I do not think we can take a call. From a short term perspective, things are not looking great.


Auto stocks will be in focus once again we have got some strong commentary coming in from Gadkari talking about how there would not be a ban and there would not be a deadline with regards to that EV transition. What do you make of those comments?The government’s support and the kind of statement which have come out are actually not supporting the sector because EV has a very small part in the overall scheme of things. Even globally, if you look at the US, China and some other markets, it is not as if because of EVs there has been a major disruption for the other automobile companies. 

What is important from the domestic automobile industries’ perspective is that instead of supporting the sector to revive the sentiment, the government introduced that petrol cess in the budget and they are taking too long to come out with any kind of a package. Thus the slowdown has got extended but despite that, we have seen a decent amount of pullback in some of the auto names. We have to see how the festive season pans out. If you see some stability or growth there, definitely it would merit to look into some of the names which have seen a good amount of correction over the last six to eight months.


There have been sporadic winners within consumption sector like Dabur, Nestle etc which have managed to withstand the slump in the economy and especially in the consumption pocket. What next for Nestle?By and large the FMCG companies have delivered a reasonably good volume growth. Even HUL, Marico and Dabur have been doing pretty well. If one has to hide in the current environment, these are some of the names where you can draw some sort of comfort and we believe these stocks would be giving you about 15-18% kind of compounded growth even when things are not looking up. We continue to be positive over there. Our preferred picks are HUL, Marico and Varun Beverages which is an acquired additional territory from PepsiCo. These are some of the stocks that we would be comfortable buying into. 


We are almost through August. The festive season is around the corner. Is it a little unrealistic to be expecting any miracles in that kind of a time frame?The expectations are extremely muted but we should wait and see how actually the season pans out because sometimes with a low base, if you see good traction, that may give you a momentum from a short to medium term perspective. Things may look better once we have a festive season.


Are there any opportunities within pharma?Sun Pharma, though the quarterly numbers were not that impressive. On the domestic front and some of the specialty business front, there is going to be a steady growth and after such an underperformance over the last three years, some of these stocks are looking quite interesting though the runup may not be very sharp. But from a risk to return perspective, it makes sense to stay invested in Sun Pharma and Cipla both."
24,2019-08-22,Nestle,"Mumbai: Employees looking to further their career prospects are likely to find the road a tough one as the spectre of job losses may expand from automobiles to biscuits. This would limit job opportunities besides affecting the confidence of fresh candidates too, said hiring experts.

After automobile makers curtail production, biscuits major Parle Products has said it may have to lay off 8,000-10,000 employees following a decline in sales. Parle Products, which makes around 90,000 tonne of biscuits per month from 10 manufacturing units of its own and 125 third-party associates, has had to cut down its production by 7-8%, following a dip in sales in the quarter ended June.

Parle Products category head Mayank Shah said the price increase taken after an increase in GST did not go down well with consumers of low-priced biscuits (under Rs 100 per kg). The new GST regime clubbed biscuits in this segment (earlier exempt from excise duty) with those priced above Rs 100 per kg (the premium variety) at 18%.

""Consumers of this biscuit segment (under Rs 100 per kg) are extremely price-sensitive. It is this segment that witnessed a 7-8% decline in sales in the first quarter and pulled down our overall sales growth to 2.5% in April-June this year from 12% in the same period last year. When we cut production, it will have a commensurate impact on jobs as well,"" said Shah.

CIEL HR Services CEO Aditya Narayan Mishra said such a scenario could create a sense of panic in the job market. ""The people laid off would find it tough to find meaningful career opportunities immediately. They would have to look at alternative industry sectors. For freshers passing out in April-July 2020, new opportunities could be limited,"" said Mishra.

Even while companies tread with caution, some recruitment firms believe this to be a temporary phase. Randstad India CFO Viswanath P S said, while some sectors like automobiles are battered, having a cascading effect on steel and aluminium, ""we do not see a direct impact on hiring."" Viswanath believes people will start spending during the ensuing festive season, and this could lift sentiment. ""By October end, we will have a clearer picture on the jobs scenario,"" he added.

The first quarter of the fiscal year 2019-20 has been marked by weak corporate earnings, indicative of an overall slowdown in various industries and the economy. Based on a sample of 2,976 companies, a CARE Ratings report said there is a clear slowdown in growth of net sales and profitability of the companies. In Q1 FY20, the net sales of the sample companies grew at a lower (about 5%) rate compared with about 14% in the comparable quarter of the previous year. Similarly, the aggregate net profit of the sample companies has also grown at a moderate rate of about 7% (year-on-year) as against the nearly 25% expansion clocked in Q1 FY19.

An otherwise resilient FMCG industry too has witnessed a slowdown. Nielsen's growth snapshot revealed a decline in FMCG growth trends from 16% in July-September of 2018 to 10% in April-June 2019. The downstream impact, said Mishra, will be seen in logistics and the un-organised sector as well. This could eventually impact jobs.

Nestle India CMD Suresh Narayanan said, ""The overall FMCG industry growth has been going southwards. But the kind of issues other sectors are facing may not get necessarily replicated in this sector because it offers essential low-budget items that are important for daily consumption.""

The good news is that IT industry, unaffected by the slowdown, continues to witness hiring.

According to the CARE Ratings report, total expenditure of the companies grew at 4% in Q1 FY20, lower than 11% in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. The increase in expenditure is driven by higher expenses towards employee compensation (about 11% growth), while a decline in the cost of materials (-1%) has helped in lowering the expenditure of the companies during the quarter."

22,2019-08-22,Nestle,"Mumbai: FMCG major Nestle India is likely to be included in the benchmark Nifty index from October following the revision in criteria for inclusion of stocks in the Nifty indices, said brokerages. Zee Entertainment Enterprises or Indiabulls Housing Finance are likely to be excluded from the index.

Shares of Nestle India rallied to record high on hope of inclusion in the upcoming review of the index before ending up 5.6 per cent at Rs 12,635 on the BSE on Wednesday.

The index is reconstituted semi-annually considering six months data ending January and July. The changes, if any, are generally implemented from the first working day of the derivatives series of April and October. Four weeks’ notice is given to market participants in case of any replacement.

Under the revised criteria, which was announced on Tuesday, stocks which are permitted to trade on the NSE platform but are not listed on NSE will also be considered for inclusion in the indices.

Considering this parameter, along with the other considerations, Nestle India is most likely to replace Indiabulls Housing Finance from the Nifty 50, said brokerage ICICIdirect. Nestle India is likely to have a weightage of nearly 1 per cent in the index after inclusion, the brokerage said.

The retail brokerage expects Indiabulls Housing to be excluded to make way for Nestle in the benchmark index.

Yes Bank is also another probable candidate for exclusion from the index, said ICICIdirect.

“The six-month average free float MCAP (market capitalisation) for Indiabulls Housing Finance is lower than Yes Bank and it is likely to be removed from the Nifty 50,” said ICICIdirect.

However, Edelweiss believes that Zee Entertainment Enterprises is likely to exit the Nifty while Nestle is likely to be included.

The inclusion of Nestle is likely to entail buying worth Rs 11crore in the stock; while Zee Entertainment may see selling to the tune of $56 million, the brokerage said."
26,2019-08-22,Nestle,"Benchmark equity indices Sensex and Nifty cracked for a third straight session on Thursday after Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) Krishnamurthy Subramanian in virtually ruled out a major stimulus package for the economy. Meanwhile, a sharp fall in the rupee and mixed global cues further weighed on market.

27,2019-08-23,Nestle,"MUMBAI: European food giants Danone and Nestle are collectively stepping up new product launches and innovations, a recipe for fending off new competition in the health and nutrition market.

Their aggression comes at a time when Hindustan Unilever is close to merging GSK Consumer brands that it acquired in its portfolio with plans to extending Horlicks into similar nutritional product segments. The integration of Complan after the acquisition by Zydus is also underway.

While Nestle is re-launching Milo, the world's largest malted food drinks brand, Danone said it has nearly a dozen new products in its pipeline, like low sugar variants, bar and ready-to-drink versions of its health brand Protinex.

“We have been launching about 10 products every year but the numbers we are evaluati ng this year are far higher and aggressive. In terms of concept, we are testing nearly 20-25 new products but now the chance of success is much higher,” said Himanshu Bakshi, managing director at Danone India. “For us, it’s expanding the market rather than fighting for space as the household penetration of protein is very low.”

The Indian nutraceuticals market is currently worth $4 billion and is expected to grow at 21% to reach $10 billion by 2022. Many mainstream fast moving consumer goods companies have been entering the market, mostly in the functional food category. HUL had earlier said that it could look at entering the nutritional and high protein segments through Horlicks while Marico launched protein shakes under Saffola Fittify a few months ago.



Danone’s Protinex, originally into the niche high protein nutritional segment, has launched mainstream variants such as mango and kesar badam and also entered the biscuit segment over the past few months. While GSK controls more than half the country’s health food drinks category worth ?6,500 crore, rival Mondelez, that owns Bournvita and Abbott, maker of Pediasure and Ensure, has been increasing market share over the past one year.

Nestle’s global malt-based drink Milo in India is being relaunched as an energy drink for sports, which analysts feel could capture the gap created during GSK and Complan’s integration. “It is purely coincidental that this is happening in an environment where GSK Consumer and Unilever are merging. The tenor of our launch might have been different had we got Horlicks,” said Suresh Narayanan, managing director, Nestle India, earlier this week."
28,2019-08-27,Nestle,"ET Intelligence Group: The stock of Nestle India hit a record high on the speculation of being included in the Nifty 50 index in its next reshuffle. However, short-term investors may well book profit in the stock if such an inclusion stands confirmed.

This is because two out of every three companies that have made it to the Nifty in the past five years have posted negative returns in the year after inclusion. As many as 19 out of the 21 stocks underperformed after a year of inclusion against their performance a year before, indicating that the Nifty inclusion comes at the time of peak performance. It is also indicative that much of the positive sentiment surrounding the inclusion gets factored in well before the actual inclusion.

For instance, the Britannia stock was included in the Nifty in March this year. The stock is down 18 per cent since, whereas it had gained 20 per cent in the year before the inclusion. Similarly, JSW Steel, which got added in October 2018, is down 44 per cent till now. It had posted 52 per cent gains in the year preceding its inclusion.

Only two – Eicher Motors and Bajaj Finserv – of the 21 stocks that got included in the Nifty in the past five years performed better a year after their inclusion in the benchmark index. Trading at very high valuation of 71 times of its trailing four quarter earnings, the Nestle stock will be the most expensive FMCG stock in the index, if included.

Nestle India reported an exceptional performance in the latest quarter to June, posting 10.5 per cent growth in volume amid overall slowdown in demand.

While acknowledging the slowdown, the management has hinted of single-digit growth this year. The company posted a smart recovery since FY16 when its flagship noodle brand Maggi got embroiled in controversy concerning its quality. The company has institutional holding of 20 per cent. Its return on net worth stands at 45 per cent and return on capital employed at 43 per cent. The company is relaunching its global malt-based drink Milo in India."
29,2019-08-27,Nestle,"We have all made losses. None of us are gurus out here. We have all got slapped very badly, but rebuilt our portfolios. Bad times come and go, but money will be made in equities again, says Sanjay Dutt, Director, Quantum Securities. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


So far the markets have not really rewarded your bullish conviction. Do you think that this time around your bullish conviction will finally be rewarded?Yes, obviously. I will start the conversation with the caveat that I have been wrong for the last few months and I can be wrong again today. But that is what taking calls is about. You will get them wrong, you will get them right, but you must have your hypothesis correct -- on what you are basing your calls. But you know, forget the gyan, the reality is that there is a lot of pain in the system. It is one of the worst phases that I have seen in the last two, two-and-a-half decades in the markets where the way the second tier or the third tier of the market was completely decimated; even good quality stocks. And what we are seeing is a structural change and not in the economy. It is a structural change in the way people look at the markets, stocks and companies. That is the actual adjustment that is happening right now which is in terms of balance sheets, corporate governance and debt. That is the pain we have gone through. 

A lot of people might have reasons that you know -- economy is in bad shape, global situation, etc -- but what India is going through is more of an India-centric issue than it has got to do with anything else. It is a cleansing process that is going on in the market and we have all been caught in the middle basically. But more or less, it is in the price, to cut a long story short. I do not think there is going to be any more damage. Yes, it may be a little bit of a painful-sideways phase that we may go through for a few months. More or less, the risk reward is favourable and obviously no one can call the bottom.


 Are you of the view that the risk reward is favourable? Have the stocks become cheap or do you think that the markets are misjudging the earnings potential? What is your thought when you say markets are positive, where is optimism stemming from?As I said a few weeks back, my basic hypothesis/basic positive outlook ahead is based on the fact that we will see much lower cost of capital as we go ahead. We have globally seen that the single most important thing per consumption, economy and companies to turn around is when cost of capital collapses. Again, we are seeing a structural shift there. Gone are the days of higher interest rates and cost of capital, just like it is across the world. We will start moving in that direction. 

Our linkages are to bond yields which the RBI is now aggressively pushing. We have observed in the last few days that everything that a borrower really gets is to be linked to the banks -- MCLR, repo rate, etc. Those kind of adjustment are once again structure changing in the financing system. People will not give credit rating relevance anymore. People are going to get very serious about who they lend to, where the money goes. Obviously, once the money goes to good quality assets, costs will come down. My hypothesis is primarily based on the fact that for consumption, production, etc, the cost of capital is going to collapse substantially. 

The government is working tirelessly on a lot of fronts to ease out the bottlenecks. In fact, if you look back on what the finance minister said last weekend, 90% of announcements were focussed on ease of business for Indians, not ease for foreigners. Ease of business to Indians, whether it has got to do with GST or funds. Obviously, we can debate the implementation and the actions that will take place, but you will clearly make out the focus. That is what I think makes me optimistic about the next year or two ahead.


Let us talk about the broader markets. There is an expectation that with the latest stimulus measures we will start to see a pick up there or a revival in sentiment. Do you see opportunity? If you do, where do you see it? Is this the right time to start picking up some of those names?Yes, absolutely. There is a good amount of opportunity in a lot of cyclicals. My top bet at this point would be something like cement because, once again, infrastructure, constructions, spending on housing projects is what the government is going to focus on. That is one sector which is the highest employment generator in India and is also linked to building materials. All the ones that have been beaten down in these sectors are going to be the first ones to benefit. Obviously, select consumption plays as more and more income is coming in hand, liquidity improving and consumption plays will start doing better. The ones which have been beaten down particularly, the second rung ones -- the Daburs, the Maricos -- not the likes of Nestle which are already at the upper end of the range. They will also go up, but there may be better opportunities elsewhere. Select good-quality financials which have been beaten down due to systemic issues will get sorted out. We cannot do without NBFCs where there is strength and conviction will be good opportunities. There are opportunities across the entire spectrum, but these are three-four areas which should be added in the shopping basket slowly.


Start buying beta in your portfolio? When I say beta I mean risk.Yes, that is a function of investor psyche and individual investor profile. Someone like me would, as you say in Hindi, take pungas right now, but a conservative, passive investor should probably not focus on beta as yet. They should just try and ensure stable preservation of capital as a portfolio strategy. Stable earnings ahead, maybe a little early, really, for a passive investor or a lay investor to start playing beta. But some of us, probably born punters in the system, would at this point of time start taking some bets. Overall, I would not advise investors who are not totally glued on to the system or not really disciplined in terms of stop loss, to start playing beta as of yet, it's too early really.


Where do you think that markets are not able to recognise the value of the business and sentiment has dragged it down? Do you think that even in this fall you should not buy those stocks because earnings will disappoint and those stocks will keep on getting derated, like Yes Bank. I mean a classic case of it going from 200 to 300 and everyone thought that it is a buy. That 300 became 60 and everyone got trapped?I would just have two or three filters for a lay investor to look at right now. Look at $100, $200 million companies. Good brands which are across sectors, good reputation across sectors and low debt. These three factors. Find anything that is Rs 1,000-2,000-crore market cap, not more than Rs 3,000 crore enterprise value -- Rs 2,000-2,500-crore top line and a good name. A clean balance sheet -- it is very important to read annual reports and understand the pitfalls. Read some research reports, there is so much available on the net for people to understand. That is where value lies right now. So, something that is trading below sales or one time sales. 

EV has been profitable last three-four years even in such bad times. Those are the places to go and have substantial market share in. You can find a large number of good-quality midcaps in the definition I am putting Rs 1,500-2,000-crore market cap, Rs 1,000-crore odd debt, Rs 500-700-100 crore debt and so Rs 3,000 crore EV. This is the broad benchmark. Since all your shows are available on the net, after it gets over go and rewind these and understand these basics. Even I have lost substantial money, so one need to worry. 

I have lost a substantial amount of money in this whole market mayhem because we threw out basic rules. If you go and fine tune these basic rules again and again, cut the noise from television channels and media and do this basic homework, if you are a direct portfolio investor, direct secondary market investor, you will make money. Discipline yourself. I admit, and I would say it again and again, no one has to be worried about losses. We have all made losses. None of us are gurus out here. We have all got slapped very badly, but rebuilt our portfolios. You know bad times come and go, but money will be made in equities again, there is no second thought about it."

32,2019-08-28,Nestle,"If consumption environment improves in the second half, we might see good growth in the personal care category but soaps and detergents will continue to do well, says Kaustubh Pawaskar, AVP, Fundamental Research, Sharekhan. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

HUL has cut prices in some of their key soap categories quite steeply at 20% to 30%. How are you looking at this at a time when demand slowdown is very evident?The management had already said that they are planning to go for a price cut, considering the fact that some of the key input prices including that of palm oil were down on YoY basis substantially. In some of the SKUs, the prices have been cut by about 20 to 30%. This will have a positive impact on the sales volume because obviously in a slowing demand environment, such price cuts would help to regain some of the volume share as well as the volume growth. Soap is a key category with high penetration level and the price cuts will definitely help HUL achieve good volume growth in the quarter to FY2020.


What is your outlook in particular for HUL when it comes to their individual segmental growth? Soap contributes nearly 30% of the turnover and beauty and personal care is a big chunk. Is this kind of a strategy likely to continue for HUL? What kind of growth do you see in these two segments?In soap and detergent segments, the company is the market leader and definitely such a strategy would help mainly because of the fact that both these are highly penetrated categories and we have a lot of original brands in this category. During times of slowdown, there is a tendency, especially in rural markets, for a cut in consumption or people might be shifting to lower priced products. 

In such an environment, it is always prudent to go for judicious pricing action and I guess the benign input prices helped the company to pass on these benefits to the consumers. We believe that this price cut would definitely help them to achieve good volume growth in Q2 in soaps category; in detergents, they are already doing well and have been achieving double digit volume growth. They are the market leaders and this move will continue to in the coming quarters as well. 

In personal care, especially the skin care segment, it will take some time for the category growth to recover. I believe it will remain in the high single digit kind of a trend. If consumption environment improves in the second half, we might see good growth in the personal care category but soaps and detergents we believe will continue to do well.


What kind of a volume uptick do you see now that a steep price cut is coming in the soaps category?We believe that at the current juncture, the volume growth will remain in the range of 6% to 8% and because monsoons have been good, the second half should be better because in Q2, we need to also consider the impact of the floods in most parts of the country. That will also have some impact on the consumption in quarter two. We expect Q2 to be more or less in line with Q1 but we should start seeing improvement in volumes from Q3 onwards. So, in H2 FY2020, volume growth would be better than what it was in H1.


What is your overall view of the FMCG space? Any picks given the slowdown? Would you be sticking with the largecaps?We like HUL in the largecap space mainly because of the fact that it is the market leader in some of the key categories and it has a good mix of product portfolios straddling pyramid. The rural mix is also very good at 50-50. When the rural economy improves and rural consumption is back on track, HUL would be one of the key beneficiaries and that will help HUL to achieve good volume growth in the coming quarters. 

HUL is the top pick in the largecap space. We also like ITC mainly on account of its discounted valuation. On the other hand, we like Marico because this year we believe that Marico’s earnings would largely be driven by decline in the copra prices and that will help it to achieve good margin uptick in the coming quarters. On the other hand, it has been consistently delivering 5% to 6% volume growth in its domestic business while international business is expected to improve. So Marico is another pick in the FMCG space.


The National Anti-profiteering Authority (NAA) has issued a notice to FMCG companies including Unilever, Nestle and P&G. The move has triggered a debate over how much flexibility they get in setting prices when tax rates change. What do you make of this notice and the impact that it would have on FMCG companies?We have seen that when GST rate was cut, most of the companies had passed on the benefit to the consumers. There was a delay in product coming into the market but in most cases, price reduction had happened. This is something which has been going for a while and we have seen companies passing on the benefit of the lower raw material prices to the consumers and the reduction in the tax rates would definitely pass on to the consumers depending on the input cost as well as demand environment.

I think actions are taken considering all the other factors as well and not just considering the tax impact. So this is something which is going around and I believe that there is some kind of delay but obviously the reduction has been passed on to the consumers."

30,2019-08-28,Nestle,"MUMBAI: The National Anti-profiteering Authority (NAA) has issued notices to fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies including Hindustan Unilever, Nestle and Procter & Gamble, triggering a debate over how much flexibility they get in setting prices when tax rates change.

This time, companies that partially absorbed higher taxes when the Goods and Service Tax (GST) was introduced in July 2017 are saying they should get some leeway not to reduce prices when tax rates are slashed. Many such companies are being questioned by the anti-profiteering authorities.

The tax rate on most FMCG products was about 15% when GST of 28% was introduced on them, an increase that was not fully passed on to customers. Subsequently, GST on products including shampoos, cosmetics and groceries was slashed to 18% in November that same year.

The NAA is taking prices for the July-October period of 2017 as the base to see whether the benefits of a lower rate have been passed on to customers. Experts said the authority is considering only one aspect of costing, which is causing problems.

“The authorities should take into consideration all factors impacting prices, including industry-specific nuances, instead of just carrying out a mechanical comparison of prices pre- and post-rate change,” said Rohit Jain, a partner at Economic Laws Practice, a law firm. “Many companies that had absorbed the tax burden on implementation of GST between July and October are now more at a loss as they are being asked to further reduce 10% without considering what was absorbed.”

Many firms say the NAA must take a product’s earnings as the benchmark to determine profiteering.

While HUL, Nestle and P&G are being questioned on why they did not pass on GST benefits on their products, other companies are also being investigated, industry experts said. In most cases, the probes are into small package products like shampoo sachets.

Industry experts said there is a disconnect between companies and the tax authorities. Most companies do not take pricing decisions merely based on taxes – they also take market segmentation, demand and price elasticity into consideration.

“Anti-profiteering regulation does not envisage a situation where first incremental tax incidence is absorbed by businesses and accordingly full reduction in tax is not passed on later,” said Pratik Jain, partner and leader, indirect tax, at PwC India. “Literal interpretation of the law suggests that businesses have to pass on the reduction, irrespective of any prior pricing decisions.”

An HUL spokesperson said that its “position has consistently been that certain methodology has to be determined before cases of alleged profiteering can be adjudicated. This is also a requirement under the anti-profiteering rules.”

As per some, it may be up to courts to provide clarity on the matter. P&G said it is cooperating with the authorities and providing clarifications.

Nestle said that it has taken appropriate measures to pass on commensurate benefits of GST to our consumers and was hopeful that the procedure followed to pass on these benefits will be appreciated by the National Anti-Profiteering Authority. “We have taken appropriate measures to pass on commensurate benefits of GST to our consumers,” a Nestle spokesperson said. “Where the benefit could not be passed on instantly by reduction in maximum retail price or increase in grammage, the amount was set aside to be subsequently passed on and was not reckoned either in sales or in profit.”

Legal experts said depositing the amount in the fund doesn’t give immunity to the company and the NAA could still slap a fine."

39,2019-08-29,Nestle,"Benchmark equity indices BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty ended in the red on F&O expiry on Thursday amid fears of global recession and concerns over US-China trade woes.

The 30-share Sensex closed 382 points, or 1.02 per cent, down at 37,068, while the 50-share Nifty ended 97 points, or 0.89 per cent, down at 10,948. 

“The market remained weak on the back of uninterrupted selling by foreign institutional investors in cash market despite the rollback of additional surcharge by the government. F&O expiry also added to the weakness,” said Shrikant Chouhan, Head Technical Research, Kotak Securities.


We walk you through the key highlights of Thursday’s session:


Lakshmi Vilas Bank cracks 5%Shares of Lakshmi Vilas Bank (LVB) tanked nearly 5 per cent after the lender on Wednesday announced the resignation of its chief executive Parthasarathi Mukherjee. The scrip settled the day at Rs 38.35 against its previous close of Rs 40.35.


CG Power hits upper circuitShares of CG Power locked in upper circuit of 5 per cent after the power equipment maker removed its founder tycoon Gautam Thapar as chairman as an investigation unearthed a multi-crore financial scam in the firm. 


Amara Raja cracks 5% intradayBefore closing just 0.16 per cent down at Rs 612, shares of Amara Raja Batteries plunged 5 per cent intraday amid reports that Brookfield was reconsidering its investment in the auto equipment company.


Sun Pharma gains 5%Shares of drug major Sun Pharma advanced over 5 per cent after Business Standard reported that the market regulator Sebi has found no merit in allegation of violation of securities laws against the company. 


Block deal in Lemon Tree Shares of Lemon Tree Hotels cracked nearly 8 per cent amid reports that 6.60 per cent of equity traded in five block deals. The scrip settled at Rs 50.70 against its previous close of Rs 57.10.


Who moved my SensexWith a fall of 2.69 per cent, HDFC contributed 100 points fall in the Sensex, followed by Reliance Industries (down 1.65 per cent), ICICI Bank (down 2.02 per cent), HDFC Bank (down 0.90 per cent) and Kotak Mahindra Bank (down 2.24 per cent). On the other hand, Sun Pharma (up 5.31 per cent), Infosys (up 0.59 per cent) and NTPC (up 2.63 per cent) helped cushion the downside.


Put/Call WritingAt the start of a new F&O series, maximum put open interest (OI) was seen at 11,000 followed by strike price 10,600, while maximum call OI was at 11,200 followed by 11,700 strike. Put writing was seen at strike prices 10,600 and 10,800 while there was call writing at 11,500 followed by 11,600 levels. The options data suggested a broader trading range between 10,700 and 11,300 levels, according to Chandan Taparia, Associate Vice President, Analyst-Derivatives at Motilal Oswal Financial Services.


Most active stocksWith 18.88 crore shares changing hands, YES Bank emerged as the most traded stock on NSE, followed by Vodafone Idea (number of shares traded: 16.38 crore), Lemon Tree (5.37 crore), Tata Motors (4.80 crore) and Suzlon (3.97 crore). On the other hand, Indiabulls Housing Finance (Rs 1,307 crore) finished as the most active stock in terms of value. ICICI Bank (Rs 1,226 crore), RBL Bank (Rs 1133 crore), HDFC (Rs 1,104 crore) and Reliance Industries (Rs 1,077 crore) ended as most active stocks in value terms. 


Spurt in open InterestWith a change of 62.13 per cent, HUL led the pack of stocks in the biggest spurt in open interest on NSE. It was followed by BPCL (47.97 per cent), Tech Mahindra (42.57 per cent) and Amara Raja Batteries (40.81 per cent). 


120 stocks hit 52-week lowsAs many as 120 stocks on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) scaled their fresh 52-week low. The list included stocks such as Alembic, Asian Hotels, Cox & Kings, JMT Auto, Jaypee Infratech, Inox Wind and Unitech. On the other hand, paint majors including Asian Paints and Berger Paints were among 16 firms that hit fresh record highs. Nestle India, Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management and Tata Global also hit fresh 52-week highs."
38,2019-08-29,Nestle,"The return of large-ticket consumption seems difficult but at least the small-ticket consumption of FMCG, consumers should come back, says Devang Mehta, Head, Equity Advisory, Centrum Wealth Management. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

 Yesterday, a lot of news came out with respect to FDI and that is definitely going to come in as a shot in the arm for a lot of these sectors. It will of course, increase competition but attract top dollar. Why does the sentiment on the Street continue to remain tempered despite all government attempts?This is clearly what sentiment can do to market participants and markets. In fact, there was a good rally when the finance minister came and acknowledged the slowdown and probably two days of good recovery was seen, but it was short lived. The sense here is that that market participants do not want to follow a false rally. 

A clear-cut signal that the Indian markets have recovered from the pessimism would only come when there will be some evidence that the slowdown has been arrested. A lot of people make a case for festive demand. The return of large-ticket consumption seems difficult but at least the small-ticket consumption of FMCG, consumers should come back. People want to see earnings, a bit of flows from the foreign investors but that has not started yet. 

As I said, there is a bit of sentiment towards equities, more or less risk-off looking at trade war rhetoric. That is the sense we get. I think it is a good time to go back to the drawing board and prepare a list of good businesses, great businesses and start nibbling into it. 

The next three months would be volatile but there is some bit of acknowledgement from the government and markets will be kept guessing about what would come from the finance minister in the next couple of weeks. A floor or a cushion has been established somewhere around 10,600-10,700, from where the market could probably come back again roaring. 


For a stock which is already at a life high, could Nestle be the curse of the Nifty? Is it anywhere indicating a peak off?We have been a big fan of the MNC theme. The multinational companies in India traditionally have always done well in bad cycles or in bad markets in India. Nestle getting into the Nifty and the consumption universe in India is aspirational. Probably people would like to consume more and more such type of products. It is probably overvalued. Will it keep on commanding that type of valuation? The answer seems to be yes with the disclaimer that it has been more or less in the portfolio of a lot of our clients. We stay positive on this type of business which commands good ROE, ROC with an oligopolistic type of product profile.


Vodafone has got the nod to raise Rs 50,000 crore more. The numbers really tell the tale with Reliance Jio emerging in the number one spot? What do you do within telecom?It is a very simple sort of trade that we can take in telecom. Probably nobody expected Reliance Jio to come in so strongly and just take market share from the incumbents. That has happened with a big degree of conviction. The market share in the data segment is now the most needed for all these companies to operate. There are only three companies which are market leaders in their own right but I think still going ahead and buying Bharti Airtel or Vodafone though there a bit of green shoots are coming out, would I think be a little more difficult as market share is more and more getting out of their hand. So my sense is that if somebody wants a larger theme with telecom plus other businesses, a combination of retail and stuff, Reliance fits the bill rather than something else. 


If someone does not have a lot of capital to allocate, what they should sell and buy fresh? If fresh allocation does not come through, is the option to churn with what people have right now?You are absolutely right. Rather than fresh allocation, it is time to revisit the portfolio and probably restructure it. Every market rally would probably have a new theme or some new leaders which would emerge. It is absolutely important that people take cognisance of that and do not stay with the loser. It is hoping against hope that all your stocks which have lost a lot of capital would come back with a bang which is again a myth. 

Rather than talking of stocks, I would suggest a couple of themes on which we have been very, very positive, In the insurance domain, I can take some names with the disclaimer that probably you should consult your advisor, before buying that. We have been absolutely positive on companies like HDFC Life and ICICI Pru in that order. 

HDFC Life again has been a stellar performer over the last few quarters. Saying that we bought at the bottom would be fooling ourselves. We bought it at a decent premium but then it saw a correction and came back gradually. The penetration and density of insurance in this country clearly says that this is one sector probably which will deserve a place in the Nifty.

Going forward, my sense is if somebody wants a 20-30% compounder over the next three-four years insurance looks that type of a sector and even ICICI Lombard which is into general insurance is the type of businesses which does not face headwind. These are non-lending companies which do not face much headwind in terms of lending or bad markets or credit environments. 

These are the type of companies one should sort of bet on. There is a lot of cushion for insurance business to probably double from here on in the next three years."
37,2019-08-29,Nestle,"NEW DELHI: Around 11 stocks rose to touch their 52-week highs on NSE in Thursday's session.

Among the stocks that touched their 52-week highs were Grand Foundry, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company, Jiya Eco-Products, Madhya Bharat Agro Products, Multi Commodity Exchange of India, Nestle India, Petronet LNG and Tata Global Beverage.

Benchmark NSE Nifty index was trading 65.90 points down at 10,980.20 while the BSE Sensex was trading 229.76 points down at 37,222.08. 

Overall, 11 shares were trading in the green in Nifty50 index, while 39 were trading in the red. 

In the Nifty 50 index, Sun Pharma, Coal India Ltd, Eicher Motors, Vedanta and HUL were among the top gainers. 

While YES Bank, Tata Steel, ICICI Bank and HDFC were trading in the red."
36,2019-08-29,Nestle,"NEW DELHI: Shares of Nestle India climbed 3 per cent in Thursday’s trade after it became the first scrip under permitted category to be included in the Nifty50 club. The stock is permitted to trade on NSE but is not listed on the exchange. 

National Stock Exchange (NSE) last week revised the eligibility criteria for inclusion of stocks in the Nifty indices.

The scrip rose 2.97 per cent to hit a high of Rs 12,890 on NSE. Indiabulls Housing, which made way for Nestle in the index fell 7.97 per cent to hit a low of Rs 420.80.

Indiabulls Housing stock also fell after CEO at Lakshmi Vilas Bank quit, citing personal reasons, leaving a question mark on the execution of the lender’s proposed merger with the NBFC.

The replacement of the stocks will be effective from September 27.

Data, meanwhile, suggests that two out of every three companies that have made it to the Nifty in the past five years have posted negative returns in the year after inclusion.

As many as 19 out of the 21 stocks underperformed after a year of inclusion against their performance a year before, indicating that the Nifty inclusion comes at the time of peak performance, ET reported. It is also indicative that much of the positive sentiment surrounding the inclusion gets factored in well before the actual inclusion.

The shares of the company closed 1.70 per cent higher at Rs 12,727.60 on BSE."
35,2019-08-29,Nestle,"NEW DELHI: Suzlon Energy with over 0.37 crore shares changing hands was leading among the most traded stocks on NSE on Thursday.

MACROS
India set for weakest GDP data in 5 yearsIndia's GDP data is due to be released today. A Reuters poll showed India’s economy likely expanded at its weakest pace in more than five years in April-June, as consumer demand and private investment weakened at a time global trade frictions have dampened business sentiment. If the latest number for expansion of gross domestic product (GDP) is 5.7% or less, the quarter had the slowest expansion in 21 quarters, since 5.3% in January-March 2014.


Consumer firms say slowdown temporaryLeading packaged food companies have downplayed the slowdown trend in consumption, calling it temporary and restricted to mainly mass-priced products. Britannia, ITC, Amul and Nestle said sales of their product categories, both premium and essential, continued to grow even as a few large categories such as biscuits and snacks witnessed slower expansion in the quarter ended in June.


RBI tighens vigil on NBFCsAbout 275 systemically important NBFCs, which would include entities from Shriram Group and Bajaj twins, will face tighter central bank scrutiny, particularly on their interlinkages with commercial banks, as RBI seeks to ensure greater stability in India’s credit landscape. Together, these NBFCs account for 85 per cent of the total assets in the sector, and are at the forefront of ensuring last-mile credit to Indians buying television sets, air conditioners, home gadgets, or cars. NBFCs constitute around 12 per cent of total assets in the banking and non-banking space.


India mounts Make in India pushIndia is targeting companies including Apple, Foxconn and Wistron Corp with a charm offensive to encourage them to shift business out of trade war-hit China. Indian officials met on August 14 and listed out “target companies” that also include Taiwan-headquartered Pegatron Corp and have started meeting them, trying to help identify best investment zones. The government is targetting nine sectors, including electronics, auto, pharma and telecom.


US, China resume trade talksUS President Donald Trump said some discussions did take place on Thursday, with more talks scheduled, Reuters reported. China's commerce ministry also said a September round of meetings was being discussed by the two sides, but added it was important for Washington to cancel a tariff increase.


Slowdown just a cyclical downswing: RBIThe economy is undergoing a cyclical slowdown rather than a “deep structural” one, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in its 2018-19 annual report. But it added that issues related to “land, labour and marketing” will need to be addressed as a broad-based downturn is underway in sectors such as manufacturing, trade, hotels, transport, communication and broadcasting, construction and agriculture.


FM says big steps to boost industry soonStating that consumption needs to be given a push, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman Thursday said the Centre will announce two more big steps in the coming days to give momentum to industry. The government has decided to increase spending and has announced a slew of measures to arrest the sluggishness in the automobile market, she told a press conference here. However, Fitch Solutions Macro Research said on Thursday the stimulus package for the automobile sector is ""too little, too late"" to prevent a contraction in vehicle sales.


Govt planning to fully exit from Air IndiaThe government wants to exit fully from Air India as it embarks on another effort aimed at divesting the loss-laden carrier after a plan to sell a 76% stake last year failed. “I believe the government should not be in the business of running airlines… and believe the government should completely exit Air India,” aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri said. “There are many who are very interested in the airline and the one who gets the airline will be very fortunate.”"
40,2019-08-30,Nestle,"MUMBAI: Leading packaged food companies have downplayed the slowdown trend in consumption, calling it temporary and restricted to mainly mass-priced products, sounding a note of hope amid a mostly grim economic commentary.

Britannia, ITC, Amul and Nestle said sales of their product categories, both premium and essential, continued to grow even as a few large categories such as biscuits and snacks witnessed slower expansion in the quarter ended in June.

Britannia has slowed down capital investment, but will continue to spend on advertising and brand building since it expects the slowdown to not last beyond six months, managing director Varun Berry said. “Slowdown is led by rural India. In six months, normalisation should happen. The base will be lower and consumers will react to what the government has done,” he said at Ficci Foodworld, a food industry convention.

Britannia, in a post-earnings conference call, had voiced concerns and said consumers were hesitating to buy even Rs 5 packs of biscuits, indicating a “serious issue in the economy”. The country’s largest biscuit maker, Parle Products, too, had said 8,000-10,000 people could face job loss if the ongoing consumption slowdown persisted.

“The statements were made in a different context and if the market conditions worsen. But we are noticing signs of a pickup already. There have been categories impacted by GST which is weighing on lower-priced items,” Parle Products executive director Arup Chauhan said.

According to market research firm Nielsen, the fast-moving consumer goods segment grew 10% during April-June, marginally slower than the year-earlier period’s growth of 10.6%. However, on a sequential basis, value or revenue growth in FMCG has been consistently coming down from its peak of 16.2% in the July-September quarter.

“There is no significant impact on staples and essentials. While growth in premium products continues, mass products are impacted,” Hemant Malik, the divisional chief executive of ITC’s foods division, said at the event.

While the slowdown is led by biscuits, salty snacks, soaps and tea, several home and personal care products including creams, detergents, toothpastes, deodorants and food items such as chocolates, malted beverages and noodles grew at a higher rate during the April-June quarter than the year earlier.

“One swallow does not make a summer. And two quarters do not spell doom,” Nestle India chairman Suresh Narayanan told 
ET. The maker of Maggi noodles and Nescafe posted 13% growth in domestic sales in the last quarter. “Small blips won’t affect the consumption story and it remained strong at 10%,” he said.

Chocolates, deodorants, malted drinks and noodles are all discretionary in nature, but grew between 10% and 15% during the quarter. “We haven't seen any slowdown and grew 25% in the first quarter compared to 14% a year ago,” said RS Sodhi, MD at GCMMF, which owns the Amul dairy brand."
42,2019-08-31,Nestle,"The bulls made a smart comeback on Dalal Street during the week gone by after two weeks of losses, as the government announced a slew of measures to stem the economic slowdown.

BSE Sensex gained 631 points, or 1.72 per cent, for the week to end at 37,332, while Nifty added 193 points, or 1.79 per cent, to 11,023. 

The equity indices kicked off the week on a firm note after the government rolled back the enhanced surcharge on foreign portfolio investors on August 23, and also unveiled a slew of measures to boost the economy. RBI’s announcement of a Rs 1.76 lakh crore surplus transfer to the government further lifted sentiment.

The Union Finance Minister’s promise on Thursday to announce two more big steps to pump-prime the economy kept the momentum going.

Below are the top stocks and sectors that created buzz on Dalal Street all through the week:


Stocks that rallied up to 48%
As many as 50 stocks from the BSE500 index managed to deliver over 10 per cent return to investors during the week gone by. They included Minda Corporation (up 47.87 per cent), Essel Propack (up 30.67 per cent), Bombay Dyeing (up 21 per cent), Sadbhav Engineering (up 24 per cent) and Oberoi Realty (up 23 per cent). 


Scrips that cracked
With a 19 per cent drop in last five sessions, HSIL emerged the biggest loser in the BSE500 index. It was followed by Reliance Communications (down 11 per cent), Suzlon Energy (down 10.82 per cent), Shilpa Medicare (down 10.30 per cent) and Shankara Building Products (down 9.71 per cent).


Top Nifty gainers
Britannia (up 9.53 per cent) stood as top gainer in the Nifty pack for the week, jumping to Rs 2,701.70 from Rs 2,466.70. BPCL (up 7.86 per cent), IndusInd Bank (up 6.51 per cent) and Zee Entertainment (up 6.25 per cent) were other top gainers in the pack. BPCL hogged limelight after the oil retailer announced plans to invest Rs 1,500-1,700 crore in building a floating liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal at Krishnapatnam in Andhra Pradesh by 2022. Media and entertainment stocks gained traction after the government approved 26 per cent FDI to digital media. This was previously applicable only to print media. Zee Entertainment jumped to Rs 373.10 from Rs 351.20.


Top Nifty losers
Shares of Bharti Airtel, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Hero MotoCorp, Reliance Industries and Maruti Suzuki slipped over 2 per cent each during the week. Most auto stocks witnessed selling pressure through the week, as investors remained wary of the ongoing slump in sales, which is likely to persist due to the slowdown in the economy. 


Stocks @fresh all-time high
As many as 13 stocks on the BSE500 hit their fresh all-time highs during the week. They included blue-chips such as Asian Paints, Infosys, Nestle and HUL. Bata India, Berger Paints, HDFC AMC, NIIT Technologies, GSK Consumer, Phoenix Mills, Pidilite and SRF also scaled new life peaks. 


Scrips at fresh life lows
On the BSE500 index, Mahindra Logistics, Reliance Communications, Ircon International, Advanced Enzyme, Inox Wind, Jaiprakash Associates, Eris Lifesciences, Indostar Capital Finance, The New India Assurance, Hudco, General Insurance Corporation and PNB Housing reeled and touched new all-time lows during the week. 


Sectoral update
Barring the BSE Telecom (down 1.61 per cent), other sectoral indices on the exchange settled the week in the green. The BSE Realty, FMCG, Healthcare, Capital Goods and Oil & Gas indices gained between 2 per cent and 9 per cent.


HDIL shares slip 8%
The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Tuesday admitted an application filed by Bank of India to initiate insolvency proceedings against debt-ridden realty firm HDIL. The scrip declined around 8 per cent to Rs 5.80 on August 30 from Rs 6.30 on August 23. The debt-ridden firm on Friday informed exchanges that Abhay Narayan Manudhane has been appointed as interim resolution professional (IRP) to run the insolvency proceedings that has been ordered against the company.


CG Power gains 8%
Shares of CG Power advanced over 8 per cent during the week amid reports that the company was planning to offload non-core assets and looking for various fundraising options to deleverage balance sheet. Meanwhile, the board of CG Power on Thursday removed its founder Gautam Thapar as chairman of the company.


DHFL rallies 17%
Shares of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation gained nearly 17 per cent after reports that the company has proposed a 35 per cent haircut to all lenders. The scrip settled the week at Rs 47.60 against Rs 40.80 on August 23."
0,2019-09-04,Nestle,"Mumbai: Of the top stocks that touched record high this month on BSE, more than half are consumption-linked, hinting that the slowdown in the consumption space has been selective and temporary and not broadbased and permanent in nature.

Of the 18 BSE500 stocks that have scaled fresh record highs so far in August, eight were linked to consumption: Glaxosmithkline Consumer Healthcare, Nestle India, Marico, Hindustan Unilever, Berger Paints India, Asian Paints, Bata India and Trent.

Ironically, BSE FMCG and consumer discretionary goods and services indices are down 7 per cent and 11 per cent so far this year. Both these indices had hit record high levels last September.

Even though high frequency indicators and channel checks point to a slowdown, experts say it is concentrated in a few sectors and areas. Barring those, all is not lost. 

“Consumption has not really slowed down. The patterns are changing in consumption. People have been slow in taking loans, but they have been aggressive in investing in mutual fund SIPs and insurance products,” said Deven Choksey, Group Managing Director, KR Choksey Investment Managers. 

“People have been buying premium products while low-end products are seeing a slowdown. Bulk consumption items are slowing down, but premium products are doing well,” said Choksey.

Parle Products, the biscuit bellwether and maker of Parle-G, Monaco and Marie, has just hit the alarm button. The country's biggest biscuit producer that employed 1 lakh workers said it could end up mass-firing some 10,000 employees if the slowdown pain does not subside. 

It is not Parle alone which is facing the heat. Amid weak consumer demand, Britannia's net profit sank 3.5 per cent in June quarter. 

The auto sector has been the worst hit. The passenger vehicles industry in Asia’s third-largest economy suffered its worst sales performance in nearly 19 years in July as a slowing economy, higher ownership costs and floods in some states deterred buying decisions.

Sales tumbled 31 per cent to 2,00,790 vehicles last month from a year ago, data released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam) showed. This was the worst sales performance since a 35 per cent drop in December, 2000.

“Consumption has slowed down, especially on the discretionary side than the auto side. Now if I look at the consumption piece minus auto, then the numbers do not look that bad,” said Jyoti Vaswani, Chief Investment Officer, Future Generali Life Insurance. She pointed out that last year the consumption growth numbers were very high. 

“All the FMCG companies have reported 8 to 10 per cent volume growth. Now on a high base, if you are growing at 6-7 per cent, that is a good number and you are getting back to a normalised growth rate,” she said.

While consumption may have slowed down in pockets, it remains a promising long-term story in the world’s second-most populous country, with varied demographics and rising middle-income group.

“The way it is being made out that there is a huge slowdown is not the case in reality. If you look at the biscuit company itself, the volume growth was there in last quarter numbers and it does not take away the fact that there is some slowdown. But is it as bad? Probably not,” she said."
1,2019-09-11,Nestle,"NEW DELHI: Nifty futures on the Singapore Exchange were trading 49 points, or 0.45 per cent, higher at 11,020, indicating a positive for Dalal Street. Here are a few stocks which may buzz the most in today’s trade:

Vodafone Idea: The telecom company’s strategy to pick cash over Esops to insulate themselves from share price uncertainties may not be paying off. The cash component may shrink, too, as the telco loses revenue market share and customers – key parameters to which the incentive is linked.

2,2019-09-12,Nestle,"Lack of GST cut in autos can really be a dampener because the market is hoping that something of this sort may come or maybe a scrappage policy could be announced soon, says Arun Thukral, MD& CEO, Axis Securities. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


The GST meeting is on September 20. Some of the key states may oppose a cut in GST rate for the auto sector. Given that the auto sector is pinning its hopes on a rate cut, would this come as a bit of a disappointment?Yes. Auto is going through a cyclical slowdown and this may be one of the triggers for the reversal because otherwise if you look at the lack of funds or the NBFC problem or the cost of ownership and whatever other recent problems we have seen, the auto sector has not been doing well and the production cuts are taking place. This could have been a great news and let us keep the fingers crossed. 

This can be really a dampener because the market is hoping that something of this sort may come or maybe a scrappage could be announced soon.


What is your outlook on the NBFC space? Do you believe that they are still not out of the woods or would you pick out select names within the sector?Obviously select names. Marquee names like Bajaj Finance and companies where a good ALM is in place and which we have seen perform over the years. Barring one or two, the NBFC sector is still not out of the woods. A lot of paper is due for renewal in the next few months and we have to see whether they get the funding or whether the rollovers will happen. As of now, we would advise investors to stay away from NBFCs.


You are positive on IT. How much potential do you see in IT? Is it just a safe haven or are you seeing this on the back of the moves in the dollar index? Are you seeing a substantial earnings growth?A bit of everything that you said. We have seen that the order size is increasing. The biggies came out with stellar results and maybe the guidance. Infosys has increased its guidance. The overall spend has increased and there are a lot of deal wins happening. Yesterday, Tech Mahindra got a big deal win and the tailwind of the rupee. All these factors augur well and they have still a pricing power unlike say pharma. We are definitely positive on IT and this is one of our most preferred sectors along with one or two more corporate and retail banks.


What is your outlook within the oil and gas space? We are looking closely at Reliance’s Aramco deal. Some of the other OMCs of late have been abuzz. Where do your preferences lie within the energy space as a whole?We are neutral on the energy space as of now. Reliance is obviously not an oil and gas story. It has got so many businesses. It is diversified into retail and telecom. OMCs do better in spurts. They do better and then at some point of time, there are regulations and a lot of speculation around oil prices all the time. 

If you look at the OPEC meet, whether there will be a supply cut, whether the US will continue to command a major share, all these things will matter. There are a lot of regulations and uncertainties. That is why we are not that bullish on oil and gas. We generally keep a neutral stand on this sector.


What about some of the consumption spaces and staples in particular? Do you find value there? The likes of Nestle, Dabur continue to see growth as well as rich valuations. Where within FMCG do you find an opportunity?We would like some of the select FMCG stocks. There was single digit volume growth in the last two quarters. Maybe, before that, there was double digit growth and now there will be base effect also. Obviously now H2 maybe slightly better because the monsoon has been doing well for the last few days. We look at that as a positive trigger and they have been able to do some kind of a price hike in the recent times. 

If you look at the valuations, they will always be costly because with a population of 130 crore people in the country, the potential of domestic consumption is going to be high. The US can have 4,000 Walmart stores or UK 4,000 Tesco stores with a much lower population of 30-35 crore. But our D-Mart has only 170 or 180 stores. Do you think we will be there over a period of time? HUL or Nestle over a period of time are going to do well because there is a huge potential and your per capita income is growing. It is more than $2000 and so there will be a rise in discretionary spending.

Mid to long term, this is a great story and you will not find it cheap and if you find it cheap, one should keep on buying in a staggered manner. That is our take on consumption, FMCG and primarily the staple products. 


What is the need of the hour for the housing market which has been in the doldrums for quite a while? Do you have any preferences within the space?Everybody is talking about the smallcap story now. This is the time to buy a smallcap and we have seen now the difference in valuation of largecaps or a mid and smallcaps over the last few months. Now, it is looking very attractive. Some time, it is very difficult to identify a good stock and maybe one of the stocks will take away your portfolio returns. 

In these uncertain times, when there are slowdown worries, we are advising our customers that in case of quality midcaps, they can buy directly but for smallcaps, they have to go via mutual funds so that you get a basket of such stocks and that is going to definitely help over a period of let us say next three to five years. You are going to get very good returns. On the real estate, I agree ou that there is an inventory but over the last few months, we have seen the inventory coming down slightly, but on and off, we find some problem with some company and then there are corporate governance issues over a period of time.

The good companies are doing well where there is not much leverage. Right now, the time has not come to go whole hog and there are some people who are taking the REIT route, maybe not buying directly but investing in one of the listed REITs. The REIT performance has been very encouraging and some more company may follow. That is how we are advising our customers to take that route -- either buy very good companies which are not leveraged or get into the REITs. There is already one and there may be more coming.


What are you doing when it comes to media? A lot of these companies have put up OTT platforms as well. There’s a lot of competition within the space. Where are you placing your bets within media?When Reliance Jio said they would be offering first-day-first-show, immediately all media companies including PVR and Inox fell. Somebody asked me the same question and I said these companies would continue to do well and would not be affected to that extent, because if you are going out with your family on an evening, the objective is not to watch the movie only, it is also going out, spending time with your family and dining outside. Sitting at home and watching first-day-first-show may not excite many of us. So both will continue and yes there is a craze for OTT now. There are four people sitting in four different rooms and watching their own series, That will do well for some time because that is the race today but finally, people will come back to theatres. 

Also, a lot of people want to go out on weekends and there is a lot of choice in good cinema. I think these media companies should continue to do well and so one should not write them off. If you already have them, hold them."
3,2019-09-16,Nestle,"The overall technical set up suggests that the broader market conditions may remain volatile with wild moves expected on either side, but a breakout above 11,100 could lead to an upside towards 11,300–11,400, according to technical analysts. Siemens, Divi’s Lab, Nestle, Maruti, UltraTech Cement, Hero MotoCorp and Avenue Supermarts among others are some of the stocks recommended by the analysts for the short term.


MEHUL KOTHARI
SR. TECHNICAL ANALYST, INDIANIVESH SECURITIES


Where are we : For the past four weeks, the domestic markets have been oscillating in a broad range. Initially, the Nifty was stuck between 11,200-10,600 but now that range has been compressed to 11,100-10,740. Generally, such consolidation leads to a faster breakout on either side. Technically, we have observed that the price action of the recent week has helped the index to convincingly cross the previous week’s high. This has happened after 10 weeks which is an encouraging sign for the bulls and indicates that the bottom of 10,740 should be held for some more time and the Nifty could reach higher levels.


What is in store: A breakout above 11,100 on closing basis could lead to an upside towards 11,300–11,400. However, a breach of 10,740 would bring the bears back and pull the index back to 10,600 level. Considering the derivative data, the long and short ratio of FIIs in index futures has reached near 23 per cent — the lowest it went since February 2018 (which was around 18 per cent). Generally, we have witnessed a sharp recovery in the markets in such conditions. Thus, chances are high that the breakout might happen on the higher side.


What could traders do: With regards to individual stocks, we are witnessing a trend line breakout in Maruti, UltraTech and Hero MotoCorp. Any dips could be used to accumulate them for positional trade. On the contrary, UPL is the stock which we would recommend to sell. The current price action on the daily chart has taken a shape of “rising wedge” pattern, which generally occurs after a drastic fall and could be considered as a dead-cat bounce. Traders can create shorts in the stock between ₹578-582 levels for the downside target of ₹555 with a stop loss of ₹592.



PRITESH MEHTA
LEAD TECHNICAL ANALYST, YES SECURITIES


Where are we : Undeterred by Thursday’s fag-end decline, Nifty marched ahead in Friday’s session. Rather than looking at the presence of supply line around three-digit Gann number of 111(00), it is now essential to focus on the overall market structure which continues to be positive. The trend which has caught our attention is the participation of broader markets (NSE MidCap 100 index up over 3 per cent since recent low of September 4). It’s no longer only large-cap driven market. We have seen different stocks and sectors participating in last few sessions (So this market is not driven by only handful of large heavyweight stocks) which makes it difficult to break the spirit of the bulls.


What is in store: Despite the strong Friday rally, range expansion is highly awaited and current consolidation could probably end in this week’s trade. A typical trend is observed in last two week’s trade i.e. buy on dips which underlines market strength and resilience. The index has completed three consecutive shifts in orbits post June peak of 121(00) and since last one month it is locked in tussle between three-digit Gann number of 106(00)-111(00). Broad based participation, churning of sectors, presence of Gann anniversary period and comeback of BankNifty in Friday’s trade indicates case of a strong upside move towards 11,350.
What could traders do: Daily ratio chart of BankNifty versus Nifty shows a reversal from point of polarity zone around 2.5. The same coincides 50 per cent retracement of the previous upmove from September 2018 to July 2019, which suggests possible outperformance from banking stocks from hereon.


ARUN MANTRI
TECHNICAL AND DERIVATIVES ANALYST, KARVY STOCK BROKING


Where we are: Nifty is currently hovering around the psychological mark of 11,000 as tough war is witnessed between the bulls and bears from last couple of weeks. In the broader market we may see stock specific action spread across the various sectors taking cues from the domestic and global news flows. The next crucial supports placed near 10,900-10,920 zones below which it may drift towards 10,800 levels. The index may witness fresh round of short covering rally if it closes well above 11,120-11,150 levels.


What is in store: We expect Nifty to remain highly vulnerable to the global and domestic developments coupled with the ongoing weakness in the rupee and rebound in crude oil prices. As per the options data of the weekly options expiry, Nifty is having maximum call writing at 11100CE followed by 11200CE while on the flip side 10900PE is having the maximum open interest followed by heavy build up in 10800PE indicating the next crucial support. The overall technical set up suggests that the broader market conditions may remain volatile with wild move expected on either side.


What could traders do: At current juncture, the volatility has narrowed to 15 per cent as depicted by India Vix index with Nifty flirting with its short-term moving average. It is advisable to avoid any directional call in Nifty till clear trend emerges on technical parameters. Meanwhile short-term traders may put their long bet in counters like Siemens, Divi’s Lab, Nestle and Avenue Supermarts which has witnessed pattern breakouts followed by Bajaj Auto and Larsen & Toubro which has added long addition in the derivative space."
6,2019-09-19,Nestle,"Mutual fund managers believe that the slowdown in FMCG sector will impact the equity schemes, particularly the thematic funds specifically focussed on the consumption sector. Will the returns from equity schemes come down because of the FMCG slowdown? The Economic Times reported today, quoting a Credit Suisse report, that India’s consumer goods industry could slow down in the financial year. The report suggests that it could be the worst slowing the sector has seen in a decade and a half. 

FMCG has always been considered as an evergreen sector (some experts call it defensive sector) in the Indian market and the slowdown in the sector is worrisome, according to mutual fund experts. “When the consumption sector starts showing slowdown, it is the first indication that the rebound need not be quick. FMCG slowdown is never good for the market. In the short term, we will see the slowdown impacting the returns, but the long term returns are also already getting impacted,” says Swarup Mohanty, CEO, Mirae Asset Global Investments.

The consumption theme fund category has offered -4.20 per cent returns in one year, 7.11 per cent in three years and 9.30 per cent in five years. The BSE FMCG index has declined 7.4 per cent in 2019 so far. The FMCG sector expanded 10 per cent in the three months to June, slower than 10.6 per cent in the first quarter of FY19.

However, fund managers specify that the sector isn’t troubled like the auto sector. “In the short term, if the economy slows down, all sectors will be impacted. In the FMCG sector, the top-line growth is intact. Be it Dabur or Nestle etc, everyone is growing at around 5-10 per cent, unlike autos where the topline is troubled. All the big consumption companies came up and said that the next quarter is expected to be sluggish. These companies realise that there might be some trouble and they are working on it,” says Sonam Udasi, who manages the Tata India Consumer Fund.

Mutual fund pundits believe that India will continue to be a consumption-driven story. “What we will consume might differ but FMCG is not a sector that will go out of favour. If you were using toothpaste and now you use a mouth wash, the consumption of toothpaste might go down, but consumption is not going down. This is a specific demographic disruption that is beginning to play out,” says Swarup Mohanty. 

Sonam Udasi believes that the long-term outlook of the sector is good and the returns will depend on bottom up stock picking eventually. “In this downturn, valuations will be stressed. FMCG has some really solid companies with good governance, both domestic and MNCs. Even today when we are taking about these issues, all FMCG companies are at an all time-high, barring those which have corporate governance issues etc. I think when the liquidity improves in 6-9 months, FMCG sector will automatically do well,” says Sonam Udasi.

The fund managers believe that long-term returns from these schemes will come down like other equity schemes. However, they believe that there will be a risk premium higher than other asset classes. “With the returns, simultaneously your inflation and interest rates have also been on the decline. Your purchasing power is intact. The problem will start when one of them goes the other way,” says Swarup Mohanty.

Finally, you should bet on thematic funds only if you understand the sector very well. “Investors who can get into these themes, understand how they work and invest, there is no issue. They would know that the FMCG sector is not going down like autos. But, for retail investors, there is a fund manager in a diversified equity scheme which can take calls on these sectors. If you are paying him/her for that job, you should sit back and keep investing. At this point, long term equity and long term debt both are attractive, but investors need to be patient with these schemes,” Mohanty advises."
5,2019-09-19,Nestle,"Most of the Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) stocks were trading lower on Thursday after Credit Suisse sounded the bugle of slowdown in the sector. BSE FMCG index was trading over 0.3 per cent lower intraday. 

India’s consumer goods industry could post its slowest pace of revenue growth in a decade and a half this financial year, Credit Suisse said, even as category leaders Dabur and Godrej Consumer sounded more optimistic about sales revival in the second half of FY20.

“We expect Q2 and Q3FY20 to see a further slowdown in revenue growth of our coverage universe to about 5 per cent. This will make FY20 the slowest year of growth for FMCG in 15 years. The last period of such low growth was 2000-03,”Credit Suisse said in a report on the consumer sector. 

Following the release of the report, Dabur (down 0.2 per cent), Emami (down 0.35 per cent), Future Cons (down 3 per cent), Godrey Phillips (down 2.5 per cent), Gillette India (down 0.24 per cent), ITC (down 0.75 per cent), LT Foods (down 1 per cent) and Nestle (down 1.6 per cent) slipped in intraday trade. 

However, Britannia (up 1.24 per cent), Colgate (up 1.5 per cent), Godrej Cons (up 1.09 per cent), Tata Coffee (up 1.8 per cent) were among the major gainers."
4,2019-09-19,Nestle,"ET Intelligence Group: Nestle India emerged stronger from the 2015 ‘Maggi crisis’, strengthening its hold over the snack-foods market and doubling its profits and stock price under new leader Suresh Narayan. Colgate-Palmolive India, under its new MD Ram Raghvan, is scripting a growth story the Street believes could be similar to that of Nestle.

The new boss at India’s biggest oral-care company has put in place a strategy that involves more aggressive product launches and is aimed at increasing the frequency of usage, mainly in the rural markets. Colgate is stepping up its marketing initiatives and outreach at a time when competitive intensity, especially from Patanjali, is waning.

As part of its strategy to expand the natural toothpaste portfolio, Colgate is now launching India’s first black toothpaste with bamboo charcoal. Although Colgate India has been present in the natural segment, this would allow it to directly compete with Patanjali’s toothpaste range for the first time.

Analysts attending a recent meet with Colgate’s management have all turned bullish on the stock. “We like Ram’s plans to drive category growth of increasing usage in rural, and not just driving the penetration and premiumisation agenda,” Manoj Menon, a leading FMCG analyst with ICICI Securities, said in a report.



Colgate’s net sales and net profit have remained mostly flat for the last 12 quarters. In the June quarter, net sales were at Rs 1,076 crore, 4 per cent higher year on year, but net profit fell 10.5 per cent.

The new MD told analysts that growth is back on agenda, and while profitable growth is important, revenue growth will be priority. Margins within a band are acceptable. Analysts estimate double-digit earnings growth (12-15 per cent) in the next three years.

Positive management commentary has led to increased interest in the stock, which is up 6 per cent but remains the cheapest among large FMCG companies. It is trading at earnings multiple of 45 times. In contrast, HUL, Nestle, Dabur and Marico are trading at more than 50 times."
7,2019-09-21,Nestle,"A cut in the corporate tax is expected to result in the highest earnings growth for India Inc since 2006. The growth in the Nifty 50’s earnings per share (EPS) may be upgraded by 7-8%. This will be a significant improvement given that the index’s 12-month expected EPS had fallen by 5% to Rs 645 after the June 2019 quarter results – the highest earnings downgrade among the top global equity markets.

Morgan Stanley has upgraded the estimated Sensex earnings growth to 25% for FY20 from 13% earlier.

Kotak Institutional Equities revised upwards its earnings growth for Nifty 50 to 25% from 15% buoyed by the sharp cut in corporate tax rate. According to Kotak estimate, automobiles, banks, capital goods, consumer staples, diversified financials and oil, gas & consumable fuels will be key beneficiaries of the cut while electric utilities, IT and pharmaceuticals will see little or no impact.



 At present, there are twenty companies in the Nifty 50 with tax rate higher than 25%. They have a cumulative weight of 39% in the index. The prominent beneficiaries of the tax cut include Bajaj Finance, Britannia Industries, HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Eicher Motors, Bajaj Auto, ONGC, Asian Paints and Hero MotoCorp. The tax outgo of these companies was more than 30% in FY19 relative to the profit before tax (PBT).

Nestle India, which will be a part of the Nifty 50 soon, will be another big beneficiary considering its tax rate of 34% in FY19.

The average tax rate for the broader BSE 500 index was 31-34% in the past two fiscals with tax outgo of Rs 2.3 lakh crore. It accounted of 34% of the total corporate tax collection, according to Credit Suisse.

The lower corporate tax may also help in improving valuations of Indian equities given the possible improvement in the return on equity. They trade at 40% premium to the MSCI Emerging Market Index, which is close to the 10-year average of 41%. A year ago, it was over 70%. A possibility of superior earnings should help in widening the current premium."
9,2019-09-23,Nestle,"NEW DELHI: The tide seems to have turned in favour of the bulls on Dalal Street after Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman cut for Indian companies, sending the fireworks on Dalal Street.

The tax bonanza dispelled earnings worries that led to massive euphoria on Friday with a spillover effect seen in Monday's session.

BSE benchmark Sensex zoomed some 1,300 points in and topped the 39,000 mark while NSE Nifty jumped past 11,600.

With the possibility of some positive developments on the Sino-US trade war front the rally might just prove to be sustainable.

""Indications are in favour of further surge in the index but the move could be gradual from hereon. We feel sustainability above 11,250 in Nifty would be critical to carry this momentum. On higher side, 11,450-11,600 zone would act as hurdle while 11,000-11,100 zone will be crucial in case of profit taking. We advise focusing on stock selection and trade management however it’s easier said than done after this vertical rise,"" Ajit Mishra Vice President, Research, Religare Broking.

8,2019-09-23,Nestle,"NEW DELHI: The government’s move to lower corporate tax rate to 22 per cent from 30 per cent is likely to ensure Rs 72,000 crore savings for about 300-odd companies in the BSE500 basket. This would improve cash flows and earnings, and may help a few companies boost demand by passing on the tax benefits to end users.

In value terms, banks and financials, oil & gas, metals and mining, consumption and capital goods companies would gain the most, analysts said. Sectors such as IT, pharmaceuticals and electric utilities may see only limited gains, they said.

Stocks such as HDFC Bank, Bajaj Finserv and State Bank of India, among others, may lead the BFSI space with Rs 27,994 crore in savings in FY21, suggests a study by KR Choksey Investment Managers.

Stocks like ONGC, IOC and Reliance Industries could add Rs 12,459 crore to profits. Metals and mining firms such as Vedanta, Coal India and Tata Steel may add Rs 8,820 crore to aggregate bottom line. Consumption stocks such as Hindustan Unilever, Asian Paints and Nestle India, among others, and capital goods companies L&T, Siemens and others may together see over Rs 11,000 crore addition to their profits.



Having said that, the stocks may not go on a relentless rally. Edelweiss Securities said after Friday’s big rally, upsides may be more modest from here on.

The brokerage projects Nifty at 11,600 by September, 2020. That said, the brokerage sees more opportunities to take on risk at stock as well as portfolio levels.

Goldman Sachs on Friday reasserted its positive view on India, and raised its 12-month Nifty target to 13,200 from 12,500 earlier, saying recent pro-growth measures, a boost to already the highest earnings growth in the region and a likely revival in sentiment further strengthen the positive investment case for India.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said companies currently availing exemptions can opt for paying the new tax rates, only once the exemption periods get over. On the other hand, companies which will avail the lower tax rate will not be able to avail any of the exemptions.

Domestic equity indices saw their second-biggest intraday rally of the year on Friday, as the Rs 1.45 lakh crore tax relief brought down effective tax rate for domestic companies to 25.6 per cent from 34.9 per cent. Sensex galloped 1,921 points, or 5.32 per cent, to 38,014, while Nifty zoomed 569 points, or 5.32 per cent, to 11,274.

Meanwhile, MAT or minimum alternate 
tax which applies to ‘zero 
tax companies’ has been reduced to 15 per cent from 18.5 per cent earlier.

“Looking at the PAT boost due to lower taxes and keeping the current Street expectations and valuations in mind, we could see a 23 per cent upside in the overall market in next 2- 3 years,” KR Choksey said in a note.

For benchmark Nifty, analysts now expect a profit growth of 24-26 per cent compared with 13-15 per cent earlier.

Morgan Stanley has upgraded its estimated Sensex earnings growth to 25 per cent for FY20 from 13 per cent earlier. Kotak Securities expects net profits of Nifty firms to grow at 25 per cent for FY2020 against 15 per cent projected earlier.

This assumes that companies will retain bulk of the tax cuts. In reality, some of them will pass on some of the benefits to consumers. If this happens, it would be the highest earnings growth for India Inc since 2006.

Among Nifty stocks, 20 companies with tax rates higher than 25 per cent have a cumulative weightage of 39 per cent in the index.

Prominent beneficiaries of the tax cut would include Bajaj Finance, Britannia Industries, HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Eicher Motors, Bajaj Auto, ONGC, Asian Paints and Hero MotoCorp. The tax outgo of these companies was more than 30 per cent in FY19 relative to the profit before tax (PBT).

Nestle India, which will be a part of the Nifty50 soon, will be another big beneficiary, considering it had a tax rate of 34 per cent in FY19.

Meanwhile, apart from recurring earnings benefit, there will also be one-time gains on deferred tax liabilities for companies such as RIL, Ultratech, among others, and one-time loss on deferred tax assets for corporate banks, Edelweiss Securities said."

A surprise corporate tax cut will lay groundwork for “second order benefits” for India’s economy over the next several months or even years, while providing a favorable backdrop for broader stock selection, according to BNP Paribas Securities India. The brokerage has re-balanced its “quality list” of stocks again after having made adjustments a day before the Indian government reduced corporate tax rates on Sept. 20. This time around it added companies ranging from large-cap stocks such as Britannia Industries to smaller names including Manappuram Finance , Abhiram Eleswarapu, head of equity research at BNP Paribas Securities, wrote in a note published on Sept. 24.

“The rally in stocks after the tax reduction has provided immediate money in the hands of investors,” he said by phone. “It provides confidence that the government is willing to do whatever it takes and will provide equity investors a chance to broaden the basket of stocks.”



India’s surprise tax cut came after economic growth in the April-June quarter slumped to its lowest level in six years, hitting the nation’s smaller stocks the hardest. While the implied valuations of 10-15 Nifty stocks are still at a premium to historical averages, the medium and smallcap indexes are still below their means, according to the BNP report.

Since the tax cut, mid cap stocks have jumped 9 per cent while small cap names gained 7 per cent. The benchmark S&P BSE Sensex has climbed 8.3 per cent in the last three sessions.

The gains show that the “first round impact” of the tax cut on company earnings has been factored in, according to Eleswarapu.

Here are the key insights from the report

Banking and auto stocks were in focus, as traders adjusted their F&O positions on the expiry of September derivative contracts. 

Automaker M&M rose on news of Ford transferring its India assets to a JV with the company. Gains in the stock helped Nifty Auto index end with substantial gains. 

Positive news about the US-China trade war, softer crude prices and a strong rupee helped sentiments on Dalal Street, as Sensex ended 396 points higher to 38,989. NSE barometer Nifty climbed 133 points to 11,573. The broader market ended the day with gains, as Nifty Midcap index rose 0.86 per cent and Nifty Smallcap index 0.62 per cent.

While the Indian market recovered from profit taking after sharp gains, the momentum was broadbased with auto, bank and metal stocks leading the gains on expectation of better demand during the festive season,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.


Here is a lowdown on the key movers and shakers of Thursday’s session:

Hindustan Zinc, Vedanta surgeShares of Hindustan Zinc climbed 5.6 per cent to Rs 213.15 after reports that the government has revived the plan to private Hindustan Zinc. ETNow reported the government was planning the residual stake sale in the company and seeking legal opinion on the same. Vedanta, which holds majority stake in Hindustan Zinc, also jumped 6.5 per cent to Rs 166.15 on BSE and was the biggest Sensex gainer. India’s largest aluminium maker is also planning to set up an aluminium flat rolled products plant with an estimated capital expenditure of Rs 2,500 crore.


YES Bank cracks 5%Private lender YES Bank fell nearly 5 per cent to Rs 51.05 on BSE even after a statement from the lender that it was awaiting approval from the Reserve Bank of India to raise capital. In a release on Wednesday, the bank said, it “has applied to RBI for approval to increase the bank's authorised share capital. Subsequent to this, the bank will seek shareholder approval.” The bank plans to raise Rs 800 crore through the process. The stock was the biggest index loser in Sensex and Nifty. 


M&M jumps on Ford JV newsShares Mahindra & Mahindra jumped 6 per cent on BSE to Rs 567 after reports that the company would receive most of Ford’s assets in India after the formation of a joint venture.

11,2019-09-26,Nestle,"The market will be driven by the private sector bank. Obviously, the weightage in the index is quite high from their side but along with banks, there are stocks like Reliance which are showing strength on the front which will contribute to the up move, says Yogesh Radke, Associate Director | Head of Alternative & Quantitative Research, Edelweiss Securities. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


We are set to see the best series of FY20 and snap all of the losing series that we witnessed so far. Do you believe that this kind of move that we witnessed last Friday is likely to continue to follow through into the coming series as well? Yes surely the Friday announcements pulled up the market sentiments. The market was really struggling and after these announcements, a positive moment has come into the market. On Friday, the way the market rallied, saw followup buying on Monday also. But on Tuesday, we saw some amount of sanity check being done by the market and some stocks corrected, the ones which are not going to get benefit immediately or they themselves going through a structural problem have corrected a bit after the rally.

I believe that markets are headed upwards with the positive moves which the government has taken and which going forward also the government will continue to take. But in this rally, there would be some sectors and stocks which will see some consolidation. Overall on the Nifty front, we believe the market is headed towards the 12,000 level in the next series also.


Would banks be the biggest contributors to this move or would the leadership come in from some other sector?The market will be driven by the private sector bank. Obviously, the weightage in the index is quite high from their side but along with banks, there are stocks like Reliance which is showing strength on the front which will contribute to the up move. There are a couple of other sectors which will attribute to the up move. But on the larger base, we like banks like ICICI, Axis in the private sector banks which will see an upward trajectory in this entire rally.


What about the auto sector? Given the way it has performed, are there any names that you would be watching out for? There are a couple of sectors which have rallied up on the announcement of this corporate tax. I believe that stocks like Maruti have significantly rallied from Rs 5,500 level to Rs 7,000. We may see some amount of consolidation because we will have to see how the numbers play out, how the auto sales come in and then the stocks will get rerated on the back of that. 

On the auto sector, we believe some more time is needed for the actual numbers to come out or at least the festive season numbers to reflect positive. We may see a follow-up buying as well as some cool off in these auto names. On the other hand, in this entire rally which on Friday and Monday, there are a couple of stocks which have created these gaps from Friday closing and the Monday opening. 

Historically we have seen that whenever there are gaps are left in the market, they tend to come to cover themselves or complete the gap before the upward rally starts. Names like HDFC Bank, L&T have gaps which could come to fill up itself before the fresh up move could be started. 

We have clearly seen this thing in Reliance that there was a gap up opening which happened after the announcement of Saudi Aramco’s deal but eventually that gap continued and did come to fill up into the system and then Nifty started moving upwards. Also something like the FIIs positioning has been there. FIIs were heavily short in the index future to the tune of around Rs 11,000 odd crore and over the last couple of days, we have seen that long index futures have been created by FPIs and some amount of short covering is also seen in the index futures. 

So around Rs 2,000 crore of shorts have been covered in index futures and simultaneously around Rs 5,000-odd-crore of longs have got build up into the index future. Net-net, there is some amount of positivity from the FPI side. The cash numbers are yet to reflect the same but the first and immediate impact happens in the derivative markets where the FPIs have covered their shorts and gone long. We may eventually see that the flows in the cash market are also reflecting the same. 

We have seen historically that whenever both the DII and FII flows are positive, the momentum in the market is crazy. In 2007, we saw how the FPI and DII flows both coming in together, pulled up the market. We have continuous flows from the SIP in mutual funds and if FPIs have also turned positive it is a double bonanza for the market which could take the markets to higher levels.


What is the trend in autos which was very hard hit in the slowdown?As explained, after the Friday’s announcement all the stocks binaries moved to maybe auto sector, banking, whichever sector was rallying on that day. A sanity check happened over the weekend where they realised that okay there are a couple of stocks which may not benefit immediately and they have rallied up significantly more than what the benefit should come in. Overall, the system is positive but something like an auto sector has to show the numbers before we really build up the next move in the auto sector.


Any outlook in terms of the broader end of the market? Any top recommendations? Anything that is looking interesting on the charts as well within the metals space as well as consumption?I would like to recommend a couple of good names. Private sector banks would be the leader in the entire system, ICICI and Axis are really beautiful on the charts. Reliance is something which has been moving quite well. Among FMCGs, with Nestle coming into the index, and also HUL or Dabur on the long side bias.


Do you like anything within the oil marketing space?The news of stake sale which is happening in BPCL has kept the momentum long. We do like all these stocks but side by side, we like to be cautious on the PSU names. A couple of PSUs are under the Bharat 22 ETF which will be launched on Oct 3 and 4. Some amount of supply could come in these names so one needs to be a bit cautious on these names, but since we have a positive outlook on the Nifty and overall Indian markets, ultimately these stocks would go higher."

Poor demand from Indian consumers could dampen the mood during festivals next month, especially for automobile makers and retailers that count on the season for a sales boost, analysts predict.

Indians typically buy everything from new cars to shoes for themselves and as gifts during celebrations steeped in religion and tradition. Yet the slowest economic growth in six years, unemployment at a 45-year high and tepid private consumption may see sales fall short of recent years, even after the government’s $20 billion tax break to companies earlier this month.

“You can make the product 50 per cent cheaper, but there has to be income to spend,” said Nitin Gupta, an analyst at SBICAP Securities in Mumbai. “In the short-term, I don’t see any kind of an income boost. Rather than giving cash to individuals, they have given it to companies.”

Car sales in August fell the most on record and Maruti Suzuki India Friday reduced the price on its Baleno RS model by 100,000 rupees ($1,420) to pass on the benefit from the tax cut. Market researcher Nielsen has lowered its 2019 growth estimate for fast-moving goods to 9 per cent-10 per cent from 11 per cent-12 per cent, while a stock gauge of consumer discretionary firms is set for its first annual back-to-back losses since at least 2005.



Even so, the industry’s fortunes beyond the approaching festival season are poised to improve, according to BNP Paribas SA. Plentiful rainfall seen this monsoon season and cash handouts to farmers will help lift rural incomes, helping sales of staples recover in the second half of the year that began April 1, the brokerage said in a recent report.

Here’s what other analysts say:


SBICAP Securities’ Gupta



The festive season is likely to be dull. Consumption is hit and household income has to increase for there to be better demand for companies selling fast-moving consumer goods.
Corporate tax cuts are a long-term phenomena and won’t help in the short term. It’s uncertain how much companies could pass on the benefit in terms of lower prices.

Harshit Kapadia, an analyst at Elara Securities India



I’m not expecting a blockbuster festive season. It won’t be muted either, but will be decent. Even last year demand was largely flat, that’s why double-digit growth in demand on the lower end is possible.
Distributors are preparing for the Navratri and Diwali season, but nobody is stocking up heavily. They are following the normal trend of keeping 15-20 days of inventory, whereas in past years they would keep 30-35 days ahead of the festival season

Ravi Swaminathan, an analyst at Spark Capital Pte



Sales growth in refrigerators and washing machines has been moderate (mid to high single digit).
With early festive demand traction not very encouraging, dealers are hopeful for better traction over the next 2-3 months.

Basudeb Banerjee, an analyst at Ambit Capital Pvt.



The best case scenario for automobiles is for demand to remain flattish on a year-on-year basis as last festival season was bad for demand. Things have gotten worse since then.
Investors should avoid commercial vehicles and producers of lower-cost two wheelers, which face a bigger inventory pileup.
Recommends selling Hero MotoCorp Ltd., Ashok Leyland and Tata Motors shares, buying Eicher Motors Ltd., Bajaj Auto and Maruti Suzuki India.


Shirish Pardeshi, an analyst at Centrum Broking Ltd.



Demand is there, it’s only the size of the wallet that’s come down. In difficult times, people don’t stop buying the product. If someone was buying a large pack before, maybe they’ll buy a small pack now.
In the festive season people tend to forget the bad times.

14,2019-09-30,Nestle,"LUDHIANA: FMCG major Nestle India expects the ongoing festive season sales to be good for consumer-centric companies but added that the next six months would be crucial for revival of consumption.

The company is still keeping an eye on short- to medium-term consumption trends, Nestle India Chairman and Managing Director Suresh Narayanan said.

According to him, while the overall demand sentiment is yet to improve, the government's recent move to reduce corporate taxes will help boost earnings of companies and stimulate the investment cycle in India.

""People are looking forward to the festive season, there is a bump that companies will get. Most consumer products companies have got expectation out of festive season. For me, what needs to be watched is the short- to medium-term which is really the next six months, how that evolves,"" Narayanan said at a media roundtable here.

""I have no reason to believe that the festive season will not be a good one but this alone will not be an answer to the longer-term secular issues of consumption that seems to be foremost in the minds of most industry people,"" he added.

The FMCG sector is struggling with low growth this fiscal, primarily dragged by consumption slowdown in the rural markets.

""It is fair to say that FMCG has clearly seen strains as far as growth is concerned, the levels of growth have come down. Rural India is seen to be worse impacted,"" Narayanan said, adding that rural demand remains a concern for most of the companies.

On commodity prices, Narayanan said prices of milk and wheat are on the higher side but because of good monsoon, rates may come down in the coming months.

Lower wheat and dairy prices would ""certainly ease pressure on commodities in term of benevolence of pricing.""

Regarding the recent reduction in corporate tax rates, Narayanan said it would translate into higher capital expenditure, more cash in the hands of shareholders and boost demand.

""I think the overall sentiment has not dramatically changed but at the same time the recent round of corporate tax reductions... is a step in the right direction for stimulating capex cycle and stimulating investment cycle in the country,"" he said.

Terming it as ""very positive steps for the future"", Narayanan said corporate tax in India is now comparable with other South East Asian economies.

India is ""attractive in terms of investment destinations as compared to many of the South East Asian countries where there have been migration of some Chinese manufacturing capabilities"".

2,2019-10-02,Nestle,"ET Intelligence Group: Corporate tax cut, no increase in cess on cigarettes and ban on e-cigarettes — ITC has never had it so good on the regulatory front. The stock gained 9 per cent in the aftermath and there have been four upgrades in analyst recommendations in the past 10 days.

But irrespective of the upgrades, the average target price, as per data on Bloomberg, stands at Rs 325 — lower than the targeted level of Rs 340 six months ago.

To be sure, unlike other FMCG stocks, there has been no rally in ITC in the recent years. It is still 30 per cent away from the record high hit in July 2017. Despite the recent relief rally in the stock, it is down 13 per cent for the past one year — even as HUL gained 23 per cent, Nestle India 43 per cent and United Spirits 30 per cent during the same period. Incidentally, its peers from the Indian cigarette industry — Godfrey Philips and VST Industries — gained 24 per cent and 30 per cent, respectively. Sagging growth in cigarette sales has been a pain point for the company.



The moot question is will ITC use the tax break to stimulate cigarette volumesRs The company has been passing on the increased tax burden on cigarettes to the smokers. But a tax break and the resultant halt in price rises shall help the volumes to grow.

ITC remains the cheapest and most favoured stock by the analysts in the sector. Data from Bloomberg show 32 of the 37 analysts tracking the stock have a ‘buy’ recommendation on it. The ITC stock trades at the trailing priceto-earnings multiple of 25, against the multiple of 46.7 of the ET FMCG Index. Investors consider it to be a dividend stock rather than a growth one. At 2.25 per cent, its dividend yield is better than its peers in the FMCG industry — albeit much lower than its global peers like BAT, Altria and Philip Morris.

It remains to be seen whether a tax cut and ban on e-cigarettes will help the company boost the cigarette volume growth that will have a corresponding impact on its stock price. Analysts see the next six months as decisive for ITC’s cigarette growth. The company's performance in the forthcoming two quarters will indicate whether it is able to make the most of these opportunities."

India’s largest manufacturer of toothpaste tubes, snack packets and other flexible packaging sees profits in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s plan to eliminate single-use plastic by 2022.

Uflex Ltd. aims to invest about $500 million over four years to build new factories and expand existing facilities focused on greener materials, Anantshree Chaturvedi, chief executive officer at unit FlexFilms International, said in an interview in Mumbai. Only recycled plastic will be offered with no new creation of the material, he said.

“We are walking away from clients telling them that we do not want to supply them fossil-fuel generated plastic,” Chaturvedi said.

Uflex is considered among the bellwethers for consumption in India, which has the world’s largest millennial population, a demographic that drives purchasing trends worldwide. While the company is also seeing the effects of India’s economic slowdown, it’s betting that increasing awareness about sustainability will offer opportunities for growth.


Bloomberg

Rising demand from the U.S. and Europe for clean packaging options will continue to boost revenue, Kentucky-based Chaturvedi said. “However, the next phase of growth will come from a combination of developing and newly developed markets such as Eastern European countries, the Asian belt, Brazil and Peru.”


Uflex’s consolidated earnings for the year ended March 2019:


Net income 3 billion rupees ($42.5 million)
Revenue rose 17% to 77.7 billion rupees, the fastest increase in seven years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Uflex is building new factories in Nigeria, Hungary and Russia. It claims to be the only company globally that provides plastic packaging film with 90% recycled material, compared with 60% for its competitors, and plans to move to 100% soon. The company manufactures abroad but packaging activity is carried out only in India and its clients include PepsiCo Inc., Tata Global Beverages Ltd. and The Coca-Cola Co.

The Modi-led administration has vowed to eliminate all single-use plastic by 2022, more ambitious than a 2025 deadline agreed by about 200 global companies including Nestle SA, Coca-Cola and Unilever Plc."

Pakistan’s already powerful military is taking an even greater role in running the country as the economy stumbles.

Army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa has privately met top business leaders to find ways to bolster the economy, according to people familiar with the matter. The three meetings Bloomberg is aware of took place this year at heavily guarded military offices in Karachi, the financial capital, and Rawalpindi, a northern town that houses the army’s headquarters.

At the meetings, arranged through mutual contacts, Bajwa asked business leaders how to fix the economy and what would lead them to make investments, said the people, who asked not to be identified. Some of the meetings resulted in prompt decisions including sending instructions to top government officials, the people said, without giving any specific examples. They said the general was concerned about restoring confidence among the business community.

An army spokesman declined to comment when asked about the meetings, however on Thursday the military issued a statement after Bajwa hosted a gathering of government economic officials and business leaders on Wednesday.

“National security is intimately linked to economy while prosperity is function of balance in security needs and economic growth,” Bajwa said in the statement.

The military, which has staged numerous coups since Pakistan’s founding in 1947, has seen a direct impact from the economic slowdown: Defense spending was frozen in the 2020 fiscal year budget for the first time in more than a decade. That comes as soldiers are on high alert against terrorists based in Afghanistan and conventional forces in arch-rival India, which has put Kashmir under lockdown.

Many business leaders and economic analysts in Pakistan actually welcome a greater role for the generals. They view Prime Minister Imran Khan’s party -- less than halfway through its first term in office -- as inexperienced compared with the military, which is the country’s most respected and powerful institution.

But others are concerned about what an ever-increasing role for the military means for Pakistan’s democracy and the future of civilian institutions that haven’t been given the space to develop.

“The growing role of the military in the economy’s management in addition to its traditional dominance of the security matters is nothing but a soft coup that is a setback for the democratic process,” said Yousuf Nazar, a former Citigroup Inc. banker and author of a book on Pakistan’s economy. “This will have far reaching repercussions,” he said, adding generally that strong-arm methods for management will not work for basic economic and social issues.


Standing With Khan
The finance ministry downplayed the extent to which the army influences economic policy. While the army chief may have ideas about the economy, “we haven’t seen any kind of process interference,” Finance Ministry spokesman Omar Hamid Khan said. “They have their own scope of activities and civilian government has their own.”

Pakistan is going through an unusual period in which the democratically elected government and the army appear to be working in sync. The army has ruled the country for almost half its 72-year-old history, leading to persistent worries among civilian leaders about a potential coup.

Khan has publicly stated his government and the army have a comfortable working relationship. He gave the 58-year-old Bajwa a three-year extension as army chief in August -- only the second time that’s happened in nearly a decade -- amid heightened tensions with India over Kashmir. Bajwa was initially reluctant to accept the extension but his personal ties with several top government leaders across the world made the prime minister press him to stay in office, according to army spokesman Asif Ghafoor.

“This is the first government with which the army is standing,” Khan said in a television interview in July. “Historically, the army and the government worked separately. Right now, all institutions are standing with me.”


Bloomberg


Economic Managers
The government estimates economic growth in Pakistan at the slowest pace in over a decade -- at 2.4% in the year started July. Pakistan secured a $6 billion loan in May from the International Monetary Fund to help stabilize the economy after a deficit blowout.

The nation’s budget deficit rose to 8.9% of gross domestic product in the year ended June, the highest in almost three decades, while record imports about two years ago had left foreign reserves dwindling. Companies across the board, from Toyota’s local unit to Power Cement Ltd. have reduced production while many others, including Nestle SA’s Pakistan unit, have cut their workforce.

In the closed-door meetings with businessmen, the army chief discussed the country’s current account deficit, the problem of corruption and slowing foreign direct investment, the people familiar with the interactions said.

“We need generals looking after every aspect of Pakistan’s economy,” said Faizan Ahmed, research head at Karachi-based Optimus Capital Management Pvt. “The army is the most professionally organized and well-run institution in Pakistan.”

A Gallup Pakistan opinion poll released in 2017 -- the most recent data available -- showed the vast majority of Pakistanis trust the military more than other institutions even while backing democracy as the best system of governance. The business leaders saw the meetings with Bajwa, who has a reputation for getting things done, as beneficial to them given the military’s power and decision-making clout.


Surprise Move
The army itself has a substantial stake in the private sector. It runs the Fauji Foundation, Pakistan’s second largest conglomerate, with interests in everything from food to power.

Yet despite its business interests and all-pervading presence in most aspects of Pakistani life, the move to seek an active role in shaping economic policy has still surprised many observers.

“While the military has historically played a key role in foreign and national security policy, its role in the economy has mostly been limited,” Uzair Younus, a South Asia director at Washington-based consultancy Albright Stonebridge Group LLC. “However, with the economy slowing down, the stakes have been raised as a persistently weak economy risks defense budget allocations.”

Bajwa has been named a member of the high-powered National Development Council, put in place in July to set the country’s long-term economic policy. A member of the army’s Inter-Service Intelligence has also been nominated to a government committee set up to monitor the energy sector.

The nation is looking to avoiding tough financial sanctions to meet global anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing standards and has also appointed a high-level committee that includes at least two senior military officials.

The army is stepping into its new economic role at a time when the slowdown has hurt Khan’s ratings.

For the first time since the elections in July last year, Khan’s approval rating has fallen to a level where more people don’t like him. The prime minister’s popularity has dwindled about 18 percentage points from 64% during elections last year to 46% in August, according to a survey by Roshan Pakistan. Khan’s proximity to Bajwa is likely to help him ride out the drop in ratings.

“Any drop in ratings or opposition alliance is not a threat for Khan because he enjoys unprecedented total complete support of the establishment,” said Rashid Ahmed Khan, who heads the department of politics and international relations at the Lahore-based University of Central Punjab. “The army is the only support that can save Imran Khan from downfall.”"
5,2019-10-04,Nestle,"We don’t need more interest rate cut, we need more money to the corporates in the mid and upper mid level to get the business going, says Ajay Srivastava, CEO, Dimensions Corporate, talking about the RBI credit policy. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


Do you think markets wanted more than the 25 bps that RBI went for? At a repo rate of 5.15%, the real interest rate is a little over 1% and there is also liquidity surplus. Banks have been parking liquidity with RBI clearly indicating that there is not much appetite for credit. What will it take to make corporates start borrowing again?See that is what has been happening. You do not write down such steep cut in GDP growth numbers in one meeting. Obviously, RBI has been significantly behind the curve and if they are saying 6.1% now, as a market operator, you would be looking at sub 6% growth rate, given the fact that RBI’s track record for predicting growth has been poor. 

So, one, there has been that big cut in growth projection; all is not well even compared to the tax cut rate etc. You have to reconsider your equity position based upon the new GDP growth rate of 6.1% projected by RBI, If you are a prudent person, you would be looking at below 6% growth really. 

Number two, it is becoming visibly clear to the market now that the tax benefit has gone to the wrong companies. They are not going to invest in this country. Nestle is not going to invest, Glaxo is not going to invest they are going to take the money back as dividend and therefore as equity investors you should be looking at MNC stocks which are going to give very happy interim dividend in the month of December that is one. 

RBI has not come up with any good proposition for dismantling the setup for real estate financing. You cannot wish away such an important sector. If you cannot revive real estate, you cannot revive economy and that is true not only for India, it is true for Hong Kong, Singapore, US, everywhere. If real estate does not do well, economies do not do well. But somehow or other, RBI has completely ignored the need to for an alternate financing setup for real estate sector, given that everything else has been dismantled now. The banks cannot lend against most of the exposures to real estate companies. It has been left on its own. I think we are going from crisis to crisis,

So, they have underplayed the crisis today. If you were a depositor in a smaller bank including a cooperative bank, you would be worried today and ask is my money safe for tomorrow? My belief is a lot of money will move to nationalised banks over next few weeks and months and therefore you the growth rate or deposit of nationalised banks will go up. 

Our markets are now grappling with the reality of a sub 6% growth rate. I do not think the bigger companies. will be impacted too much because the tax cut will give them benefit, but the smaller ones may be affected. What kind of MSME growth rate can we talk about? For that matter, even the midcap stocks will be affected.


When the Governor was asked if RBI is willing to cut interest rates further, he said there is no lower boundary as such. Does that make you feel a little bit more optimistic or do you still feel that the position is worse than what the RBI is projecting?I do not think the interest rate is a worry. People are not understanding what is happening to the economy. What is happening is that the access to credit itself is a problem. When we talk of bank loans today, the bank loan is equal to a loan against a house. If an entrepreneur goes for a loan, they ask him do you have a house? What is the value of the house and that is the loan they give you. There is no concept of business loans.

Large sectors of the market, for example, the real estate sector for instance is devoid of any financing. Interest rate is the least of the worry. Today, the actual interest rate paid by most companies in India is 9% and upwards. So, RBI reducing rates to even 5.15% is extremely good, no problem with that. I do not think we want a lower rate. The problem is that at the lower end, nobody wants to lend in a system without the collateral of a house or a real estate and business loans are absolutely gone.

On the upper end, larger corporates have access to credit either in the bond market or with the banks. But the big chunk which was being quasi serviced through the NBFCs is now left on its own. I do not think that interest rate is a worry at all. The worry is access to credit. If that changes, a lot will change, I do not think we need more interest rate cut, I think we need more money to the corporates in the mid and upper mid level to get the business going. 

The problem is not the interest rate. The interest rate can come down further but I do not think it will come down and the reason is that the inflation that we keep talking about at 3% is wrong inflation. Healthcare costs and everything else has gone up many times. So which inflation are we talking about? The urban Indian does not see 3% inflation, he is looking at 7-8% inflation in real time today on education expenses, healthcare, petrol, fuel bill etc. 

The basket composition of inflation does not represent an average consumption basket for an individual today. Let us not worry about interest rate let us worry about getting money to the people who need it."
6,2019-10-08,Nestle,"NEW DELHI: The government’s appeal to reduce plastic usage has pushed companies ranging from Nestle, McDonald’s, Parle Agro to Amul and Flipkart to search for environment-friendly solutions. Swiss food major Nestle, for instance, has incentivised consumers in Dehradun and Mussoorie by giving them a packet of Maggi for every 10 empty Maggi noodles packets. The company is also trying to solve the challenge of serving hot beverages in 100% paper-based options.

Similarly, the maker of Amul-branded products — Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF) — has appointed agencies to pick up multilayer packaging (MLP) packs of ice-cream sticks that are trashed by consumers. “There is a cost involved in doing this and we will be spending the requisite amount. However, this will not be passed on to consumers,” said GCMMF MD R S Sodhi.

Parle Agro, maker of soft drink Frooti, said it will spend over Rs 50 crore in the next three years to implement an end-to-end PET plastic waste management programme. All the recycled plastic will be channelled to textiles and other non-allied industry segments, according to the company. Nadia Chauhan, MD and CMO, Parle Agro, said, “Given our 30% growth rate, our ‘PET sustainability’ investments will most definitely increase every year.”

While Flipkart has applied for a provisional application for patent of recycled paper-based, perforated two-ply corrugated roll for wrapping purpose and apparatus for manufacturing the same, US burger chain McDonald’s has stopped using several single-use plastic items in its outlets.

Most companies aim to fully comply with their goals within the five-year deadline (2025) they have set for themselves. However, it looks unrealistic due to supply chain constraints and the lack of viable cost-effective alternatives to plastic in the market. The steep cost of initial ramp-up stage during the rollout of alternative solutions, too, is being borne by these companies. 

Kitchenware brand Tupperware India said it will stop using single-use plastic for its product packaging, and will instead use recyclable paper-based compostable packaging material. The company’s expenses are expected to increase by around 7% due to the transition.



“A certain amount of PET bottles may still be recycled as they are in good supply from rag pickers, but ‘multilayer’ packaging that is used in the food-processing sector to increase shelf life is notoriously difficult to recycle. And there aren’t many cost-effective options either,” said former Coca-Cola India head Venkatesh Kini, who has co-founded a global online aggregator of startups — Ubuntoo, focused on developing environment-friendly solutions for industries. 

Maggi pouches, for instance, fall in the ‘multilayer’ packaging category along with several other products such as shampoo sachets, which account for 70% of all shampoos sold in India. “We have already started our journey towards transition to mono-material packaging and have initiated production for two of our products — Maggi noodles and Munch. For Maggi packaging, in compliance with the plastic waste management rules, we are currently managing it by either using it as fuel by sending it to cement kilns or by sending it as waste to energy plants,” said a Nestle India spokesperson.

Other large consumer goods companies such as HUL, PepsiCo and ITC, which use multilayer packaging, aim to use 100% of packaging that is reusable, recyclable or compostable within five to 10 years. They have currently launched extensive waste management programmes across the country to collect and recycle different forms of plastic waste. Flipkart claims to have already reduced plastic application by 25% through initiatives in its packaging value chain. The largest public sector lender, State Bank of India, with 22,010 branches (as of March 31, 2019) has proposed to do away with the use of plastic folders and single-use plastic bottles with eco-friendly substitutes across all offices.

While India’s per capita consumption of plastic of 11kg per year is low compared to 109kg for markets such as the US, the problem lies with an inadequate waste management system that sends most plastic into waterways and landfills and eventually into the human food chain. Last week, the government clarified that there is no ban on single-use plastic, and the ‘Swachhata Hi Seva’ campaign launched by PM Modi is about creating awareness and a people’s movement to curb its use."
7,2019-10-10,Nestle,"There has been a slowdown in the overall market. But if you are down from a growth rate of 10-12% to 9-10%, it does not mean the world has come to an end, says Suresh Narayanan, CMD, Nestle India. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


We have been witnessing a slowdown in the market, demand is slow, consumption has come down. How have things been for Nestle?Honestly, I cannot comment about what the results are likely to be. All I can say is that in terms of the numbers, certainly as put out by Nielsen, there has been a slowdown in the overall market. The rural growth being a lot more pronounced in terms of the coming down, I would still reiterate what have been saying for a while now that from a growth rate of 10 to 12%, if you are down to a 9% to 10%, it does not mean that the world has come to an end.

It possible that with the steps that the government has taken and is taking now, the latest being 5% increase in DA for government employees, that also will spur consumption to some extent. Plus, an improved investment climate is being created by the cut in corporate taxes. I am still reasonably hopeful that in the next couple of quarters, we will start bouncing back to the growth levels that we have seen and I would not really despair if growth has come down by a few percentage points.


That is your outlook for the FMCG sector as a whole in the near future?That is right. I can only talk about the FMCG sector because I do not have knowledge about the other sectors. The other sectors have their own endemic issues and they have both structural and tactical issues that they face. There is a different set of prescriptions that will apply to them but certainly for the FMCG, consumer goods space, we might have a little bit of turbulence but that does not mean that the aircraft would not lend safely.


We are in the middle of the festival season. This is the time when demand is at its peak. Do you think the demand is lukewarm as compared to previous years?It has been a mixed bag. For example, in the smaller towns, there is a positivity due to the festivals. I have not seen in my own market visits, any dramatic changes at least as far as the consumer goods sector is concerned. There have been of course reports in some other sectors that the buying patterns have been much more muted, but certainly in the consumer goods space it has been by and large on an even keel.


While we complain of a slowdown in the retail sector, online selling platforms like Flipkart, Amazon have registered record sales. What does it say about consumer behaviour?That is why I said that there could be some issues in particular channels, but that does not mean that the overall consumption space is doom and gloom. You are right and I have also read reports about the $3 billion sales that has been achieved by some of the major ecommerce players. 

It is fair that the millennial generation has a greater propensity to buy on e-commerce platforms for a variety of reasons, including the lower prices and also the convenience. We will see this shift over a period of time and therefore we need to see things in aggregation and not just say that there has been a slowdown in a particular geography or in a particular channel and paint that same brush for the rest of the consumption space. I would still be reasonably optimistic. We can have the bumps, but overall, all is not lost.


What does Nestle have in store for consumers during the festival season?I just want to keep all smiling and happy and therefore we continuously innovate. We continuously offer new and exciting products from the Nestle stable and hopefully we will keep enjoying your trust and confidence in the coming months and years.


Any new product in pipeline?As I told you, our task is to be as innovative as possible. as close to your heart as possible, as trustworthy as possible. If we are able to steer the course, I would be quite happy.


Government has taken a series of measures as you mentioned before. Have these already started showing impact? What more do you expect the government to do?The overall impact has been on corporate earnings outlook because of the cut in corporate tax. That will play itself out, it will not immediately happen but once they post earnings, there would be an effect in terms of better dividends and part of that being put back into consumption. Some of the other steps being like the DA hike would also have salutary effect."
8,2019-10-11,Nestle,"IT bellwether Infosys jumped 4 per cent ahead of September quarter earnings on Friday as traders expected a better show from the company. Shares of Indiabulls Group also registered solid gains, as two of them announced board approvals for share buyback.

TCS faced the heat after a below-expectation Q2 show and it ended in the red. However, Nifty IT index closed with decent gains, rising 1.5 per cent. Nifty Metal Index was the biggest sectoral gainer, climbing 2.3 per cent for the day.

Sensex saw volatile trade before closing 246 points higher at 38,127. Nifty rose 66 points to end above 11,300.

“The market turned volatile amid a weak start to the earnings season and a spike in oil prices as tensions rose in West Asia. The market regained composure in the latter half, as increased optimism over a US-China trade deal and a strengthening rupee attracted value buying,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.

Here is a lowdown on the key movers and shakers of Friday’s session:


Indiabulls shares jump
Shares of Indiabulls Ventures climbed 4 per cent to Rs 103.50 after the company’s board approved buyback of 12.61 per cent shares. Shares of Indiabulls Real Estate also jumped 5 per cent after the board approved buyback of Rs 500 crore worth of shares. Indiabulls Housing Finance also soared 7.7 per cent to Rs 210.


TCS feels heat over Q2 nos
Shares of IT major TCS shed 0.9 per cent on BSE to close at Rs 1,987 as Q2 numbers came in below Street expectations. Global brokerages slashed their price targets for the stock after it reported tepid growth in net income for September quarter at Rs 8,042 crore, and guided towards more challenges putting a question mark over its ability to deliver double-digit growth.

YES Bank slides further
Shares of YES bank slid 3.3 per cent to Rs 39.60 on BSE even as its single-largest shareholder and co-promoter, the late Ashok Kapur's daughter Shagun Gogia, on Thursday extended full support to the bank management and agreed to cut her stake if there was a strategic investor ready to invest in the company.


Cipla dives & rebounds
Shares of Cipla slipped as much as 5 per cent after brokerage Equirus raised concerns over its Goa unit that received 12 observations from the US drug regulator. However, the stock later rebounded to close about 4.5 per cent higher at Rs 441.


Infosys jumps ahead of Q2 show
IT giant Infosys jumped over 4 per cent to Rs 815 on NSE ahead of its Q2 numbers which came out after market hours. Post market hours, the company posted its numbers in line with Street expectations.


Airtel’s best week since March 2015
Bharti Airtel continued its stellar run and rose 1.4 per cent to close at Rs 382.65 on BSE, registering its best weekly gain since March 2015. The stock climbed about 13 per cent during the week.


Metals come to party
Metal stocks registered solid gains led by Vedanta and Jindal Steel, both of which jumped over 3 per cent. Hinalco, Tata Steel and Coal India also recorded decent gains, rising more than 2 per cent each. Nifty Metal Index rose 2.3 per cent for the day.


Top Sensex movers
Infosys and HDFC were the biggest positive contributors to Sensex, contributing 118 and 37 points, respectively. Other positive contributors included HUL, ICICI Bank and Maruti Suzuki.


25 stocks blinking ‘buy’ signals
As many as 25 stocks crossed above the MACD signal line on Friday to indicate a bullish trend. They included Cipla, Canara Bank, Tech Mahindra, Bharti Infratel, MCX and Nestle India."
12,2019-10-14,Nestle,"As the US Fed moves towards quantitative easing, end 2019 and 2020 will prove to be a very interesting year for the under-owned segments and emerging market equities. In the Indian context, it will be the small and midcaps, says Anshul Saigal, Chief Investment Officer, Kotak Portfolio Management Service. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


If I look at the market from the Nifty prism, it does not smell like a bear market but the minute I turn my attention to small and midcap stocks, it reminds me of 2013 and 2008.You are right. I will explain this phenomenon in some detail. The equity markets are akin to a reservoir of water or a dam. It rains and the reservoir gets filled with water and it creates energy. You open the gates, the reservoir loses water and the water flows out. 

In the context of equity markets, the reservoir is the equities, the rain is liquidity. As liquidity comes into the reservoir or equities, equity prices move up. As liquidity is drained out, equity prices come down. While in the Indian ethos, rain is brought by Lord Indra, in the context of the equity markets, rain or liquidity is brought by the US Fed. So, if the US Fed turns off the tap, you see equity prices going down.

If we go into recent history, you will see that between 2009 and 2014, they expanded their balance sheet from $1 trillion to $4 trillion and kept buying equities and risk assets. Between 2014 and 2017, they kept the balance sheet flat at $4 trillion. In 2018, there were as many as four interest rate hikes and a reduction in balance sheet by $800 billion. So, the gates of equity markets from the reserve currency were opened and as a result, you saw Indian equity markets and in particularly, the small and midcap space as also the emerging markets correcting meaningfully. 

Now fast forward to September of 2019. In the last three weeks of September, we saw as much as $180 billion of liquidity being pumped in by the US treasuries. So, $800 billion were taken out in 2018, $180 billion brought in three weeks of September of 2019. If this liquidity tap is being opened by the US Fed, and from quantitative tightening we are moving towards quantitative easing, then 2019 end as also 2020 the whole year will prove to be a very different year and a very interesting year, particularly for the under-owned segments and emerging market equities. In the Indian context, it will be the small and midcaps, you go around the world and you will see that small and midcaps have been hammered out of shape. In our judgement, that segment should do well, as also cyclicals.


What is the best way to understand the NBFC space? Right now, the bear market survivors are HDFC, Bajaj Finance, even Chola or Sundaram Finance. When the bull market comes back, could these stocks be way higher than where they are? There will be a market share shift in the NBFC space. You will see quality, well capitalised NBFCs gaining market share. The other trend that you will see will be from the asset side of the balance sheet. NBFCs which have chunky loans will probably in the future lose market share and those that have granular loans will gain market shares. 

Essentially, granular asset side and sufficient capital on the balance sheet will benefit NBFCs going ahead. Whichever NBFCs have these characteristics, will gain share. The other aspect to this NBFC crisis is that whoever attracts equity capital at this time or is able to raise equity will again remain strong and will come out stronger on the other side of valuations. 

Whoever cannot attract capital will again remain a fringe player going ahead. This industry is going to see a lot of consolidation. The froth that we have seen in this industry over the last two-three years is now behind us. We do not anticipate that this froth to return in the coming future. Of course, there will be another cycle which will be 5-10-15 years ahead where a similar sort of situation will arise but not in the near future. Whoever comes out of this well, will do quite well going ahead because they will gain market share.


We have got a whole host of beaten out names that are seeing some momentum today. If we are to pick up certain stocks that could offer value at the current levels, any particular names that you would like to share with us?I would refrain from taking names but I would just say that in this market, you are seeing a lot of good growth companies with strong balance sheets which have seen growth in the last three to four years, as also in the last year, having corrected 50-60-70%. 

Our psychology will tell us to not invest in a company which has corrected 50-60% but this is precisely the time to go in and invest in such companies if their balance sheets are strong and their businesses remain solid because these companies will see an expansion in valuations going ahead. I see a whole host of them in the small and midcap space today. I also see a lot of cyclicals and PSU names which are at attractive valuations today. Those are the spaces that one should look. It is not too difficult to run screeners and come to names where balance sheets are good, valuations are reasonable, prices have corrected and businesses are strong and have grown in the last one to two years. 

Run those screeners and look for companies in the small and midcap category. It is hard from these prices to go wrong over a three to five-year period.


I was told that it is hard to make money in Nestle or a D-Mart because they are so terribly expensive but in the last two years what I have seen is more concentration by money managers, more PE expansion and decent earnings growth. What lies ahead for a Bajaj Finance or a D-Mart or for that matter Trent, or Asian Paints?You and I have been in the markets long enough to have seen the period of 2000 to 2009. If you bought an Infosys in the year 2001, it compounded its earnings for the ensuing eight years at about 35% to 37% year-on-year earnings growth. What did the stock do? Zero. It made you no money over a nine-year period. A quality company, with 35-37% earnings growth made no money over a nine-year period. It was the same thing with HUL in the same period. 

Valuations matter. At times like these, when there is polarisation in certain segments of the markets and those segments continue to do well, people forget that valuations matter but it is a heavy price to pay in the long term to buy at such valuations. 

Of course, within the set that you mentioned there will be some companies which will continue to do well despite expensive valuations, but at the margin, at a time like this the risk reward is highly favourable for cheaper names which have been hammered out of shape. Who is to say that for the next three months, there would not be volatility? There can be volatility but if you have a 3-5-year time horizon, there is a ton of money to be made in that segment and the risk reward is favourable. 

I would lay my bets against the over-owned large quality businesses which have seen polarisation and I will be in favour of those names which are under owned and having been impacted, the valuations have become favourable and their business models remain as strong as they were, till about a year ago."

11,2019-10-14,Nestle,"We are not much worried about HUL margins. Going ahead how the revenue trajectory takes shape and whether the company is able to meet the earnings expectations for FY21 is going to be the key factor, says Naveen Kulkarni, Head of Research, Reliance Securities. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

Are we in for routine numbers from HUL where volume growth would be a subject of slowdown or can HUL spring in a surprise and beat the Street?I am a bit sceptical though they can still surprise on the margin front because raw material costs have been benign and competition activity has been on the softer side. From that perspective, the margins could be better. The EBITDA growth could be quite strong. But the key factor is nominal growth rate is sluggish and we see HUL cutting the prices of its products further. We will start seeing the impact of that in the forthcoming quarters. 

The demand scenario remains to be seen in the commentary of management and that is critical. Also the GSK acquisition and integration will be quite closely watched by the market.


The rest of the consumption pack probably would be hoping to get its cues from this. But let us just break this down a little further. Could we see price cuts in select portfolios? Is there a possibility of margin expansion and if yes, how much?The margin expansion is very likely because what happened was in the last quarter, there was a significant amount of margin expansion. From that perspective, even this quarter, it may not be any different in terms of margin expansion. A 100 bps plus margin expansion on YoY basis is very likely and that is what is going to aid the EBITDA growth rate which is likely to show a double digit trajectory. 

Margin expansion is happening because competition is soft and there are savings in the advertising expenses. If HUL is cutting prices in some of its soaps categories, then it may not spend more on advertising in those categories. Definitely, there will be savings in terms of advertising. Raw material costs have been benign and the growth margins should also expand. 

So margin expansion is pretty much given. I do not think there is much doubt whether margins will expand or not. If margins do not expand, according to market expectations, then that will be a negative surprise more than anything else. I do not think we are much worried about the margins, but going ahead how the revenue trajectory will take shape and whether the company will be able to meet the earnings expectations for FY21 is going to be the key factor. Right now, the expectations built into the numbers are quite aggressive. That is going to be the key challenge that HUL will have to deliver upon.


At Rs 2,000 plus, is HUL pricing in a constructive scenario?Yes very likely so. HUL does not have a significant amount of benefit of the corporate tax rate cut, that is one. Second, the synergy benefits which that GSK will bring in, are getting factored at around Rs 2,000-odd levels. A lot of positives are already factored into the price right now. An important thing from here is the revenues have to start growing at a much faster pace than what they are growing right now, for the company to justify the current valuations.


 Is ITC underperforming because markets are confused about where the FMCG business is heading or is it a global disenchantment towards tobacco stocks that will keep ITC under pressure?ITC is not performing because of mix of multiple factors. One is of course there is a lot of global PSU funds which have a very clear cut screeners about not investing in a tobacco company.


Which would be the dark horse then from the FMCG space? Which is the company that is looking attractive right now given the recent slowdown is available at a good price point?Not much foreign investment is happening in the tobacco sector. Of course, there are regulatory challenges and that is essentially keeping the stock down. What looks to me like a dark horse or what could be an interesting company that can create a lot of value over the next two to three years is Dabur.

Dabur has a reasonably decent portfolio of brands. It is one of those companies which is now looking at investing and focussing and building on brands, whereas the market is going in a different direction. So Dabur has the capability to turn around and build in this slowdown kind of a scenario. Valuation wise, it is cheaper than the MNCs like Nestle or HUL. There is an investment case in Dabur from a medium- to long-term perspective.


Dabur, Nestle, ITC, HUL are giant companies. Is there any niche FMCG company where the business is growing and the management is decent?Most of the FMCG companies have become quite large over the last 10 years odd. From that perspective, finding a mid-size FMCG company might be a challenge. A $1-billion company is going to be in an altogether different kind of FMCG space. 

Most of the FMCG companies are still quite sizable and I would say that the secular growth story still lies with the staples, in terms of penetration. We will still go with names that are doing pretty well and then one can look at some of the retail companies which can deliver sustainable growth over longer periods.


Are Indian retail stocks the most expensive retail stocks in the world? Trent is at a PE of 100, plus minus 10, depending on the estimates; D-Mart is at 60-70 times PE multiple one year forward. India must the only place where the retail stocks are at a very large premium. Globally all retail stocks are under pressure because of ecommerce.One of the ways to look at retail stocks is the valuation aspect and the second aspect is essentially the business model. Some of these companies like Titan or D-Mart have a very robust business model in terms of the per store turnaround time that these companies can deliver. If, the per store turnaround time is quite good, three to four-year timeframe, you are making a return of close to 20% plus kind of an IRR. That generates a lot of cash to deliver intrinsic growth for a very long period. Because the market opportunity in India is so large, that always will continue to look very attractive. 

The important aspect will whether the business model can generate sustainable cash or not on a per store basis. The challenge has been not many people have been able to replicate the model. That is what stands for these companies and over a longer period of time, these companies are likely to generate significant cash flows. That is why the valuations continue to be sky high for these companies and growth rates also continue to be quite high."
13,2019-10-16,Nestle,"“The tragic comedy is that water is not as simple as it's presumed to be.” 


India’s first and only water sommelier - yes, that’s an actual thing - can identify the different types of water, in addition to telling you why they taste a particular way. Certified by the Doemens Academy, Ganesh Iyer has been in the water trade for over two decades, and launched six brands including Evian, Ferrarelle, Perrier in India, before he joined Veen - where he’s now the director of operations for the Indian subcontinent. 

Till the early 2000s, when there were over 1800 water brands in India, everyone put a mineral water label on their bottles. It was only after a campaign with the Ministry of Health & Consumer Affairs, that lasted for almost three to six months, was an agreement reached to have classifications for water in the country. 

“Now, broadly there is packaged or bottled drinking water, and natural mineral water,” explains Iyer. 

The former (regardless of whether it comes in plastic or glass) is simply water taken from borewells at any location, that has undergone the reverse osmosis process, and has artificial minerals. 

Meanwhile, natural mineral water always has a single natural source (a spring, an artesian well, reservoir or glacier), and while it’s impossible to sport the difference usually, there is a quick tip. 

“The one thing to look out for is rawness. Natural water will taste very, very raw, while packaged water is sweeter.”

Veen, that sells natural mineral water, found its source in Bhutan - the only carbon-negative country, when it decided to enter the Indian market. 

The Finnish brand sells water in glass bottles as a step towards going green.

It’s a pitch that is tuned to the present-day scenario where most brands are trying to go the plastic-free way. Whether it is PM Modi lauding a Bollywood cast for not using plastic bottles on set, or actress Sonam Kapoor asking for mineral glass-bottled water in Mumbai - only to discover there are only 2 such brands available in the Maximum City (Veen being one), the cry has got only louder.


AgenciesFor the Indian market, Finnish brand Veen found its water source in Bhutan.

Market Measures
Iyer understands the water game, in a way very few do. And which is why he is confident while debunking the ‘purest water’ statement that many claim to make. 

“How can you say this is the purest water? What is the benchmark?

“There is no global standard to measure it by, but it's simply the might of the company making the claim.” 

He goes on to explain, “Nestle manages almost 80% of the water brands in the world, and if they were to say that they are the purest and pump in 3 million on a campaign, it will just be marketing that people will believe."" 

While ‘purest water’ is out of the way, there is one hack that Iyer swears by: drinking boiled water.

“Nothing beats boiled water. Plus, drinking lukewarm water is the best way not to fall sick, so that’s an added bonus,” he says from experience. 


Iyers says the well-travelled Indian consumer is “ready for change, and is willing to experiment with water, too.”
Though the age-old, grandma-recommended boiled water has this sommelier’s stamp of approval, he himself remains lukewarm when it comes to alkaline water crowding the retail market. 

“The natural alkaline levels in the body cannot be altered or refilled by drinking more alkaline water. It’s not a magic potion, just a style statement. Even if one was to drink it regularly, you would need 8-10 years for it to show any effect,” he explains.

Thanks to an upgrade in lifestyle habits, the Indian consumer, Iyer says, is “ready for change, and is willing to experiment with water, too.”

But he’s quick to clarify that Veen is not catering to the audience that drinks Bisleri. Recognised globally as a Michelin water, the brand doesn't have a retail policy, and is only available at hotels and restaurants. 

Even while selling at Rs 400 a bottle, the brand doesn’t want to associate with the luxury tag.“We wanted to create a product that is premium, however, we don’t call ourselves luxury. If we did, we’d just sell two bottles,” he dismisses with a laugh. 

Adding that “Veen is no longer a status symbol, but just natural mineral water from Bhutan in food-grade glass bottles.” 


Learning Curve
Despite an expansive knowledge of not just water but also the market, Iyer’s thirst was not quenched. And which is why he started tracking the 17-day water sommelier course at Doemens Academy in Graefelfing a few years back. 

In 2018, having done his research, he joined water enthusiasts in Germany for the course, that cost approx. Rs 3.5 - Rs 4.5 lakh. 

Ask Iyer, who returned as the country’s only water sommelier, about the motivation that took him across continents, and he says it was the need for ‘a certified validation’, in addition to being intrigued by the technical aspect of water.

“The course taught me that water has an age, it can go bad, and every water is different in terms of taste and minerality. I also learnt about the various tastes that water can have - sweet, bitter, salt, umami, fat, metallic,” Iyer explains, with his voice giving away a sense of fascination.

But that’s not all.

He’s also mastered the art of water pairing. “Just like wine, water too should be rightly paired with food, and liquor. 

“If you’re eating sea-food, pair it with low-carbonated water. And when it comes to single malt, always pick water that has low TDS (total dissolved solids). Don’t pair it with heavy mineral water, else the true flavour of the single malt will be lost,” Iyer recommends.

16,2019-10-23,Nestle,"We will look back to this bottom formation period next year and the year after and see 2019 as a year when very firm foundation was laid for the economy, says Manish Chokhani, Director, Enam Holdings. Excerpts from an interview with Nikunj Dalmia and Ayesha Faridi of ETNOW.



Markets always vote for a change of focus on where the buck will move rather than where the buck has moved. Are the markets at the current juncture, pricing in all the bad news? It is not an economic crisis but there is certainly a slowdown. Do you think a lot of bad news is in the price?I think so. We have spoken about economic cycles and market cycles in the past. If you recall we have talked about phase one, where there is a catalyst and something causes the markets to go up while the people remain sceptical. Then in phase two, broader earnings come through. Phase three is when the PE multiples expand; phase four is the sharp correction; phase five is the pullback and it becomes very narrow; phase six is the bust. What we call phase zero is when everyone is throwing everything at the problem. So, RBI would be cutting rates, the government would be cutting tax rates, everyone and his uncle will be calling up to say what can I do, how can I make this better? We are in that period. 

We will look back to this bottom formation period next year and the year after and see 2019 as a year when very firm foundation was laid for the economy. It was very much like the 2001-2002 period where you got the catalyst in the form of privatisation and in the form of some important commodity or sector taking off. That is what one would look forward to in the forthcoming Samvat. I am completely onboard. Markets are now fed up of being pessimistic and are looking ahead to better times ahead.


Where will the new stories come from? Time and again, if you dig out data for the last 10 years, it is the same set of names which have done well. Quarter after quarter, it is an HDFC Bank or a Bajaj Finance or a TCS. Has time come to move beyond these so called A listers?I am conscious that it is not appropriate for all retail investors to do what we guys are up to, but like you alluded, there is a segment, where because of the structural shift in the economy, the market leaders and the governance leaders are going to gain disproportionately. Whether it was in retail, real estate or banking, those people will keep doing extraordinarily well. If the economy is going from $3 trillion to $5-6 trillion, you cannot still have an HDFC Bank at a sub $100-billion market cap. In the context of where it can be, these will keep compounding and despite so many cycles in the past 20 years, one learning I had was that some of these good companies keep compounding.

There is no reason to shift away from quality to something else, but stocks which have become midcaps by virtue of either the economic cycle or commodity prices and so on. There is a nine million tonne steel company which is trading at $1-$1.5 billion market cap. Now at some point in life, it has to go back to a $8 billion kind of valuation and while there is a debt overhang today, over two-three years as this gets repaid, you will look back and say hey there was a four-five bagger sitting there and we missed it. 

There are enough things to do in the market and I sent you all some data ahead of the interview where it showed 500-600 reasonable quality companies are down by at least 67% from the all time high and it extends all the way to 80-90%. Now normally if you are down 80-90%, it either means the company is going bust or when it comes back, it comes back roaring. 

PSUs in aggregate are down between 65% and 80%. BHEL I saw was down 80% from it’s all time high. A lot of the stocks will be 2-3x before we realise what happened and no one would have participated because nobody owns them. There is enough to do for investors outside the top 50 companies, where everyone has gone and hidden out. Individually there is enough situation over there.


Let us look at the four pillars of the economy – exports are shaky; private sector or investment cycle is still shaking very badly; consumption is seeing a slowdown -- cyclical or temporary we do not know and then there is government action where there is some hope. Which block do you think is going to move higher and will ensure that the economy will heal and earnings pick up?Each time, when you start a cycle there is a catalyst which is met with disbelief that we are experiencing now. Who is going to invest? We generally will have a broad brush approach for everything in India and India is not about the averages but about disaggregating. Even in the private sector, it is not like the cement people are not investing. Even in steel, while the IBC code is throwing up opportunities, it is not like people are not investing there and they are already at 130-140 million tonnes of steel and are likely to be heading upwards. 

So there is enough of investment going in over metals, cement, oil and gas. If we have a 65% services economy, the growth now comes from services rather than manufacturing or agriculture and a lot of that investment actually happens in banks. It is also happening in retail, IT, transportation, logistics and so on. It is not that the investment cycle is dead. It is because there is a clear demarcation between those who are dying and those are who are thriving and so the average is showing a 5% print. 

Those who are doing well are actually doing remarkably well including in real estate, a sector that nobody likes. But stocks like Godrej and Prestige were up 60-70% even last year. Even in PSUs, just the whiff of a possibility of divestment in BPCL and the stock was up 80% last year. There is enough opportunity everywhere…


The other cluster is the ones walking the walk of shame; DHFL, Indiabulls, Yes Bank and as many as you want. What is interesting is there are conscious promoters who are ready to do anything to save their company. Perhaps part of the pain is over in YES Bank. We have even seen Bajaj Consumer trying to deleverage balance sheet as have the Zee promoters. Is there any hunting opportunity within this pack or would you say, do not be a cowboy?No, it is not for the average investor. It is a space that I look at personally, because where there is a forced seller, where there is a debt holder who is selling because he has to cover and he does not have a view on the underlying asset, you occasionally get real gems and fabulous prices. 

We all grew up reading Warren Buffett. The famous salad oil scandal of American Express, you get opportunities like that once in a lifetime and in India too, there are some opportunities like that. 

I would not talk about Zee, but in aggregate if I add up Zee, Sun and Network 18, that is 50% of the eyeballs of India and in aggregate the market cap of these three is less and $7 billion and these are free cash generative businesses and it is not like OTT is going to take over the world tomorrow. Even today, with the problems that Netflix will have once Disney comes in and so we will see. 

Two, what is the buying power of the Indian consumer to pay for this and will television completely die? So they deserve to be six times EV/EBITDA, for example, when we are buying chemical companies now at 14-15 times? There is a bit of a travesty happening over there. There are nuggets, there are some sectors, some companies which you go in and if you can understand what is really going on, can be a very interesting opportunity. 


We have these 15-20 stocks which are considered safe but they are also very expensive. If you are a value investor, what do you do?
If you disaggregate India into three buckets, there is what I call the 2% of India which is like Australia and they have a third of GDP. Then there is 20% of India which is like Philippines which has a third of the GDP and then there is 80% of India which is like sub-Saharan Africa which has a third of GDP. 

Now the normal case for India investing for consumers was that this 2% can expand 10x to become the 20% and the 20% can expand 4x to become 80% and that gave you the terminal values when you draw up a DCF. That is what classically most foreign investors would look at, on a nominal basis if this country is going to grow 11-12-13% and if you get a crazy number at the end. 

My son tells me, you have been investing for 30 years, has there ever been a case where India surprised you on the upside? For 30 years, we have been waiting for this J-curve of consumption to take place in India and then you reach a sorry state where in 2020 we barely sell 3 million cars, of which 90% are one box cars -- the Marutis and the Hyuandais and we think the market is x growth. By reference, China is at 27-28 million cars and the price point there is not a Maruti Alto. The price point is a Toyota Altis. So it is almost a 30x larger market than ours and we have given up hope already on what will happen. 

While the normal consumer stocks, the Nestles and the Levers are pricing that in, the discretionary stocks may be autos, media, a lot of refrigerator, AC stocks. What is the sale of refrigerators and air-conditioners in India? It is a hot country and if you have a long enough kind of a horizon and can live with some of these multiples, a lot of these companies will grow into it.

For example, for 20 years, there is Nestle (which I own) and every time I keep it as a 1% position because if I build it to 5%, I will feel tempted to sell it as it is too expensive. It just gets compounding. Same is the case with HDFC Bank. Each time you look at it, you wonder what will it do? But you know that it is not yet $100 billion market cap. When the country is $5-$6-$7 trillion, can the largest bank of India be 100 billion or will it be more like $400-500 billion, if you can just keep the faith. The mistake we have often made is exiting the winners too early because we get greedy and make 5x somewhere else. But 20% compounded over 5-10 years is a fabulous number.


India is on the recovery path. If I work with the assumption that tomorrow will be better than today, is one better off sticking to these great businesses where you may not get great returns or should one start treasure hunting?We have made money in the past in PSUs. I remember Hindustan Zinc was sold for something like $250 or $300 million. From that $200 million, it went on to have a $20 billion market cap. It was up 100x and it gave dividend of $3 billion to the government. Since then, the government continues holding 30% of that company. I do not know why they do not sell it, but that is another story. That is the level of wealth creation which is possible because they are sitting on fabulous assets. It is just that they are held back by capital constraints or by governance concerns or they are just not incentivised to perform that much better.

It beats me how could someone go and find more minerals in a mine which anyway you would not and the same people are running it.

The aggregate market cap of all PSUs today just by way of reference is less than a $140 billion. It is a staggering number that 50% of India’s assets in a sense are sitting in the PSUs. The market cap is $140-$150 billion on a 2-2.5 trillion kind of overall market cap and they have all fallen 65% to 80%. In theory, if they just recover back, they are 3x from here which takes you back to a $400-$500 billion which gives the government money to repair its own balance sheet. The issue in India has been that that balance sheets are broken right now."
17,2019-10-30,Nestle,"If stock prices are doing well, an economic recovery is perhaps a few months down the line. When markets are turning, if you feel the next 12 months’ trajectory for the Nifty, Sensex is great, then it is the tier II, tier III which will outperform the tier I stocks, says Dipan Mehta, Founder & Director, Elixir Equities. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


Is it true that Nifty is 500 points away from an all-time high, the market breadth has stabilised, FIIs have stopped selling and finally HNIs have also started buying?What can I say, 
acche din aa gaye (good days are here).


But are good days really here or is this momentary rise, not a rally?Stock markets are lead indicators and if stock prices are doing well, an economic recovery is perhaps a few months down the line. By and large, there are cycles and this particular base cycle seems to be over and going forward, if there is no incremental bad news and in the financial front, there are no blow outs as far as fresh slippages are concerned, gradually the economy will start improving and that will get reflected in stock prices as well. 

The corporate tax cut has been a game changer and it is now pretty evident in the earnings which are coming through. You may keep on arguing that PBT profits are same but at the PAT levels, the earnings per share which is the most important data point for analysts for valuation those are improving significantly even where companies have been reporting flat to negative growth rates. 


Yes, margins have gone higher, cash flows have improved and corporate can now start spending.Absolutely yes. All these factors put together give a lot of confidence and in any case, there was always money waiting on the sidelines globally as well as in India. It just needed the right tipping point and that came with the September 20th announcements. The markets have clearly turned.


The challenge is Nifty has been fooling us. We may be up 10-11% over last one year, but it has all been about the 5-6-7 stocks. If you bought those stocks, it is great. But crowded trades are seldom over-owned trades. Should we stop looking at the Nifty for now?You can do that at your own pedal. Fact is that we all benchmark ourselves to the Nifty. Mutual funds, fund managers look at the Nifty. It is a major global index and if it is going up and those five stocks are taking it up, then so be it, you cannot argue against that. But I do feel that we are getting into a more broad-based rally. Across-the-board sectors are starting to do better, take cement for example. Now auto, auto ancillary has also turned around. So by and large we are getting the rhythm back in the market. Of course, there is still a concentration of trade in the good quality 10-15 stocks, but it is percolating to the rest of the market and this trend will only gather more. 

Everybody knows that those 15 stocks are expensive but nobody wants to touch the tier II, tier III stocks because of various uncertainties -- earnings balance sheet, corporate governance, whatever. But incremental flows will find their way into the tier II, tier III stocks and the gap which has been widening, has started narrowing already and this trend will gather momentum.


Looking at BPCL, you want to do a bit of a double take. The government’s divestment drive has taken off. Do you think a lot more strategic stake sale is required or the fact that they are even have got this on their priority list is a major positive?It is a reform process and the market thinks that it is the beginning of a major reform process as far as PSUs are concerned. The problem with the PSUs is that there is excessive control by the government over the PSUs and these are in businesses where they should not be. Because of whatever reasons, they are not as efficient as the private sector and if a disinvestment like BPCL goes through successfully and the political fallout is manageable, then it will embolden the government to do more such disinvestments. In order to do that, they will have to first clean up the PSUs as far as control, corporate governance, efficiency, all these factors are concerned, make them attractive for the foreign or local investors who want to look into it.

 The whole process is a very powerful investment theme and many investors will like to ride on it. Also what favours PSU is low valuation, businesses are great businesses in terms of monopolies. Balance sheet wise, they are all excellent, at least the listed ones and they have very high return ratio. They are great businesses in the wrong hands and if those hands are changing, or if there is a subtle change in the way as those PSUs are being managed, then there is a great scope for PSUs to rally even further from this side. 

The classic, the best stocks to buy are the ones where we see earnings increasing and the PE is expanding and that is possible in the PSUs where the earnings also move up and the PE multiples kind of shoot up.


While Air India, BPCL are very large disinvestments and some of them are of strategic importance, do you think government will be easily able to slip a Concor or BHEL out?It should be, let us see how this plays out. Right now, it is all up in the air. Let one disinvestment get done in the right spirit because in the past government has tended to sell its own stake from one PSU to another.


 … ONGC, HPCL or PFC and REC…It is an evolving situation and if it happens in true earnest, we have to see what is the political fallout. But just to start buying stocks based on the idea that they will eventually get disinvested, is like taking a punt. It may work out, you may take a small exposure to it but the likes of BHEL or even BPCL for that matter can never be part of the absolute core holding.

The top five holdings cannot be these companies because we have seen in the past that the government goes back on its entire plan of disinvestment and then these stocks end up going nowhere like a BHEL. I do not know what is the scope in terms of earnings growth and other factors we value it on, but if you disinvest it, then the new player who comes in will sell the land, will reorganise the business, focus on the right products and turn around the company and extract its full value which the government cannot do. 

Also keep in mind that the PSUs have got very strong labour unions as well. How that plays out also is extremely important. It is early days as far as India’s strategic disinvestment programme is concerned. Let us see how it plays out that is what I should say.


What do you make of the move in auto names post the festive season? Double digit sales growth that has come in, strong commentary from the likes of Anand Mahindra. Can we say that they are safely out of danger zone or would you attribute this purely to festive demand?The turnaround in auto was long overdue and it is great that we are seeing these kind of pickup, especially in the festive season. Most analysts and industry observers say let us see what happens in November, December or so. 

The advantage in auto is that we get quality data month after month and we are getting even registration data these days, although that is not as accurate. As an investor in auto industry, I would like to see a few more months of double digit growth rates, see how that is playing out before deciding on the increasing exposure to auto. 

But I tell you one thing I am not happy with is the long-term trajectory of the auto industry. It is not a sector which is going to be a market favourite over three-four years or so. The reasons are partly structural, partly comparative intensity, partly disruption which is taking place within the sector. 

I would be very careful to play the auto shares going forward. They are great trading bets because they had been oversold, under owned and now you have some positive news flow, so you will quickly have that upswing. But can they scale to their previous highs and give returns from that on a consistent secular basis? I am not so sure.


Lot of funds have bought into NTPC of late. It is one of the top holdings of Prashant Jain and one of the top holdings of S Naren. Their logic is utilities do well when interest rates are declining and frankly except for NTPC and the Adanis a little bit, no large corporate group has added a lot of power capacity. Is there money to be made in a stock like NTPC which frankly for the last couple of years has been a dog of a stock?Not the last couple of years. Since listing, it has been a huge underperformer and when the markets are down, you want to go for value plays. Price to book is great, dividend yield is fantastic, you get steady cash flows all that is fine but what makes money in the stock market is growth and that is missing as far as utilities companies are concerned. 

By and large, there is a fine balance between installed capacity and demand at least at the price point at which we are just now. The monthly figures for electricity generation and consumption are not showing double digit growth and if you want to make money in the market, you have to find businesses which grow at least 15-16% at a reasonable valuation. That particular assumption has not changed. 

You could have trading rallies in the likes of NTPC or some of the other slow growth PSU companies and that is what it is. In one year, it may give you 15-20%, even 30% return, but then for the next five years, it may remain at the same level, whereas other growth stocks may become multibaggers.


What is your view on Yes Bank?We had fantastic results from Axis Bank and ICICI Bank. If you go back two-three years ago, Axis and ICICI had corrected 45% from their peak. They are in a similar situation where IndusInd and RBL are just now. Yes Bank is in slightly deeper mess than these two banks but if Axis and Yes Bank can come around from the problem they were in, providing for all the NPAs, cleaning up the balance sheet, raising capital and are now on a solid growth path, then the same can get repeated in IndusInd Bank or an RBL and maybe even YES Bank as well. 

In investment, we do not want to buy the best bank but best investment opportunities are where there is stress just now, valuations are cheap, there is uncertainty as far as their slippages are concerned.


Survival?Survival also but if they live through these tough times, then these stocks can give you 35-40% compounded return over the next two-three years or so. Banking is a great business to be in in India.


Demand will never be a problem. It is a credit-starved country.Exactly. When you have a situation like this, I would like to put the stressed-out banks on my radar and look for opportunities over there. I would watch them closely, see how they are turning around, see how they are playing out and maybe get higher returns in the likes of Axis, ICICI, HDFC or Kotak. When markets are turning, if you feel the next 12 months’ trajectory for the Nifty, Sensex is great, then it is the tier II, tier III which will outperform the tier I stocks.


Given that we are talking about some of the PSU names now, would you look at specific names like SBI that has also delivered?SBI came up with a great set of numbers and ironically these days the PSU banks have better provision coverage ratio than the private sector banks and it does seem that now maybe the likes of SBI and some of the larger banks can provide some amount of consistent growth going forward. Again there is scope over here for the valuation ratios to improve the price to earnings or price to book or so. 

I would say that one should not be negative on likes of SBI or some of the larger stronger PSU banks as they have scope to deliver good returns. They will have some amount of volatility in the earnings, but the overall move maybe quite positive going forward.


Last time we spoke you said you were preparing a portfolio for the bull market, stocks where you can get 40-50% return in the next two years and so that when the bear market comes, my 50 becomes 25 and yet I get a CAGR of 25%. What are you trying to buy in that?As I said that the focus is more on the second level players over there. In banking, we are looking at IndusInd Bank, RBL. In NBFC space, something like an L&T Finance is looking quite interesting, being available at reasonable valuations. That is another sector we are looking at. 

And then across the board, within the consumption space -- appliances, FMCG to an extent. Within FMCG, I am looking at the likes of Jyothy Laboratories or Godrej Consumer which have underperformed HUL or Nestle. That is the theme that we are trying to follow through and depending on how the results are and how this particular rally shapes up, you will get better returns in the second level stocks than the stocks which have been outperforming so far. So you could see a turnaround over there.


Would you trade out of a Nestle if you own it or a D-Mart or Bajaj Finance purely because they are expensive or would you like to keep it simple. You may not make money in six months but you will also not lose a lot of money?It is a difficult one to answer and the way are going to approach it is incremental flows. The incremental flows come from households, it comes investors cash flows. Incremental flows are not in the Nestles and the Bajaj Finances and HDFC Bank. Incremental flows are in riskier bets and gradually if you have 70-80% in the safer stocks and if you move that ratio lower through incremental flows to 40-50% or so, over the next two years, you would have a nice outperforming portfolio with certain amount of stability. Whenever downturns come, the top holdings will remain quite solid over there.


Insurance has been a sector that has been growing very steadily, More opportunities here?We like the insurance sector. And I will give you a stock with usual disclosure that we and our clients are invested in. We like ICICI Lombard in the general insurance space. It is India’s largest private sector insurer and if you want to buy a private insurance company, this is the only standalone listed company, the rest are all part of holding companies like a Kotak or a Bajaj Finserv or so. 

So we are very positive over there and this is a great secular growth story. It will gain market share at the expense of PSU banks and what we like best is that this company focuses on profitable business. In crop insurance, it does not get the right yields. It exited out of it completely at the expense of losing out on large revenue. But it is very focussed, well managed and it is a great business.


If you are not bullish on autos, why are you bullish on ICICI Lombard because a large of their insurance is actually autos?That is a bit of misconception over there. Not only do they insure new vehicles but the older vehicles also need to be insured and there are changes in the Motor Vehicle Act which benefits insurance companies. And now they are moving more into even mediclaim and general insurance, fire insurance. So, it is a completely diversified company and it can have a solid growth going forward, at least maintain its 15-20% type of top line, bottom line growth. It is an expensive stock, around 50 times or so, trailing 12 months. But it is a steady one and we do feel that it can give good returns going forward."
19,2019-10-31,Nestle,"Nestle would be the least likely to maintain the earnings growth they have delivered in the last three years, Bajaj Finance more likely and for Trent, it would depend on their strategy, says Naveen Kulkarni, Head of Research, Reliance Securities. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


The SBI meet yesterday has been quite comforting. It is not for the first time, that SBI has made these comforting remarks. In the past also, every time they have given a commitment on asset quality, something has gone wrong. Do you think this time it is different?What is different right now is that to some extent, the challenges are better known. Let us say that we go back a couple of quarters where they gave a guidance of 1% ROA for FY20 and Q1 results did not live up to their expectations. But that also had to do with a lot of challenges that we have seen on the macro front. SBI is a large bank which is impacted by the changes which are happening on the macroeconomic front. 

Since the macro situation seems to be improving and we are seeing a better second half for the year, there are better chances for SBI to live up to the expectations of the market from here on. I am more constructive on SBI now. The macro situation seems to be much better than what it was three months back. We are now looking at a better scenario.


You have actually said that consumption may be challenging. Talk to us about that. What are you anticipating because that seems to be the first theme that everyone is betting on?Yes. It is challenging from stock point of view which is essentially for consumer staples. There could be challenges with regards to the nominal growth rate number. Consumer staples depend a lot on the price actions and price hikes which to a large extent is also led by inflation. 

So that is a front are not very comfortable with. The nominal growth rate there could be slowing because the input cost could be passed on. Competitive activity might also pick up. So those things can impact the consumer staple space. 

On the other hand, the consumer discretionary space can pick up in a meaningful manner if I look at something like the auto sector where the numbers are down quite a bit now. They are starting to improve slowly and that is a space, I believe can do better from here on. What I mean is different for different set of themes within the sector.


What is your take on the IT sector? Should one be a little bit selective within the space? You have changed your rating here. What brings about this change in approach? How have you looked at the key numbers within the IT space?The IT space continues to be interesting primarily because it is a large allocation. Companies in that space have decent return ratios. Apart from that, they have no challenges with regards to debt or anything else and there are a lot of cash flows which are essentially to back the growth going ahead. 

In terms of recommendations, TCS disappointed in terms of numbers. Infosys reported a decent set of numbers but the new challenges which Infosys is facing right now and the correction that the stock has seen, might provide a good entry point at this point in time. At around Rs 650 to 680 levels, it is a decent entry point for Infosys. Apart from that, we are still quite okay with the midcap space because a long tail of growth can still come in here.


For the next three years do you think a Nestle or a Bajaj Finance or a Trent will not give even single digit returns? The three names are completely different themes. I believe Nestle will find it challenging to deliver the kind of returns that it has delivered in the last three years. If I were to look at the aggregate food business, the kind of profitability that the space generates and the growth prospects, there is a mismatch between the market cap and the growth prospects, at least for Nestle.

Bajaj Finance is altogether a different ball game. The growth rates tend to be very high in that space. Essentially the stock price is a function more of growth than anything else at this point in time. For the next three years they can sustain the kind of growth that they have delivered in the last three years, probably just a few percentage points lower. So a 25% CAGR in terms of earnings growth for a Bajaj Finance is possible. 

Trent is in a different zone. If they play their cards well it could be very big. If the online and other forms actually start challenging the brick and mortar model, then it could be a different model. 

So all three are in different spaces. If you ask me which is more likely to deliver the kind of returns which they have delivered before, I would say Nestle would be the least likely, Bajaj Finance more likely and for Trent, it would depend on their strategy.


What is the outlook on OMCs? The earnings for this quarter are going to be pretty good. There is not much doubt about that. So, that is one aspect. I do not think earnings is a big challenge for OMCs at this point in time. Probably even the next quarter should be reasonably strong. 

Earning wise, OMCs look reasonably strong. Of course, the OMC sector has been in limelight primarily because of divestment and the re-rating which has happened on account of that. Over the medium to long term, how this is going to play out is something which remains to be seen. 

If I were to look at BPCL, with the kind of capex that they have done for refining complex crude, delivering sustainable return ratios is going to be a challenge but on the other hand, the marketing margins and the GRMs are likely to be reasonably good in the medium term. It is a mixed kind of play. There are challenges with regards to the operating performance going ahead but in the current scheme of things, the earnings and the news on divestment are going to take centrestage. The stocks will continue to remain in limelight."

According to the buzz on Dalal Street, these factors may guide markets this week:

RCEP meetRepresentatives from 16 nations will meet on Monday in Thailand to announce the result of their seven-year long negotiations on Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). India is one of the parties to the negotiations. Analysts have warned that India joining the bloc could not go so well for the country. It runs the danger of seeing adverse impact on domestic producers, cautions a report from the State Bank of India.

Further in the week, the US will release Redbook data, Services PMI, crude and natural gas inventory levels."
2,2019-11-05,Nestle,"Earnings have beaten street expectations on margins as well as on the outlook going forward, says Vivek Mavani, Independent Investment Advisor. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


What do you make of the earnings season so far?As far as earnings are concerned, This is one of the better earnings seasons anytime in the last three or four years. In the last 12 to 15 quarters, this probably is one of the better ones. The number of disappointments so far have been much less. Lots of companies have beaten the street expectations. I am evening out the earnings growth because of the tax adjustments which a lot of companies have done because in the middle of the quarter, we have had the tax cuts. A lot of companies have adjusted that in the second quarter, but if I look at pre tax profit or EBITDA, a large number of companies have shown expansion of margins. They have beaten street expectations on margins as well as on the outlook going forward while managements have been slightly more optimistic than the Street. The market levels seems to be suggesting that the current rally picked up pace as the earnings season got on. 



What have you made of not just Dabur’s earnings today in terms of the kind of volume growth they delivered, but also some of the other consumption and FMCG names as a whole?FMCGs have been delivering consistently on the earnings. But valuations is something that is slightly discomforting in the sense that the very high quality names like HUL, Nestle and 3M or AstraZeneca and Pfizer in the pharma space, have been trading in 60 to 90 times range. But at the same time, one really does not have the courage to go out and sell those stocks.

Funnily enough, all the incremental money in the market is also chasing only these stocks. There was a study done as to where are the incremental flows going in terms of what stocks are getting bought into in terms of top 50, 51 to 100 and so on. Some of these stocks saw incremental fund flows in the market as far as institutional flows is concerned. Neither are these declining, the existing investors are not selling in a big way and they continue to see buying interest notwithstanding the fact that all of them are growing at high single digit or low double digits. 

None of them really are growing at convincing 30-40% growth rate so that you would still want to buy them. Nevertheless, among the consumer FMCG companies, Dabur, at least on valuation is slightly lower, of course, it makes up with a slightly lower return on capital and return on equity vis-à-vis other FMCG space. 

On the longer term perspective, Dabur is relatively better placed with a product profile where the world is moving towards preventive healthcare and more towards herbal ayurvedic medicines. That clearly is a trend in India and Dabur is well placed to capitalise on that at least they have the right products at the right place. We need a greater management aggression, which we see in Patanjali. If that kind of aggression were to be in Dabur, probably the stock price would be much more. 


Within the midcap universe, what are you buying at the current levels?Bharat Electronics is something that is interesting to me. The results disappointed with almost 35% fall in pre-tax profit margins, declining from may be about 25% EBITDA margins same quarter last year to about 19% this year. 

But this is a company that one does not look at quarter by quarter. One looks at annualised trends. They have a very robust order book of Rs 56,000 crore which is more than four years of revenue. Even if you account for the growth, it is more than three years of revenues going at the current rate. That’s a terrific track record in terms of consistency, year after year, not necessarily quarter by quarter.

A debt free very strong balance sheet delivers 17-18% return on equity and from the valuation point of view just about nine times EV/EBITDA about 13-14 times earnings. Bharat Electronics (BEL) is something that I find attractive. A disclaimer, we already have an interest in that. 

KEI is another stock which I find interesting and worth accumulating at lower levels. Again, it has a very good track record in terms of consistency of growth, margins, return on capital, return on equity, cash flows. All the numbers that you put in and the valuation at Rs 545-550 is not very demanding. This is another atocks that I would be accumulating on declines."
1,2019-11-05,Nestle,"Sunil Singhania, Founder, Abakkus Asset Manager LLP in conversation with Nikunj Dalmia of ETNOW on markets and more. The combined profit of HUL and Nestle is about Rs 7,600 crore and their current market cap is about Rs 6 lakh crore. For that money, you are getting the entire steel, metal and cement sectors, whose combined profit is Rs 70,000 crore plus, says Singhania. Excerpts:


Why are markets rallying despite poor economic data?We have seen a very challenging environment for both the economy as well as liquidity. However, one thing which has changed is there is now a confidence that the government means business. Whether it is the FDI tweaks, the big corporate tax rate cut and other significant announcements, it gives confidence that the government will do whatever is needed to bring the economy back on track. 

There have been major announcements like strategic sale in PSUs where there have been multiple advertisements inviting consultants and bids for a few PSUs. There has been a confidence that there is a move towards pushing whatever it takes to bring the economy back on track and it has coincided with a fairly robust international environment. If you see, most of the global markets are at 52-week highs. The year-to-date returns for Dow, NASDAQ, the German index and for some of the other Brazilian index are all giving 25%-27% year-to-date returns. That has also helped the market. 

The most important thing is the spate of negative news flows which you were seeing continuously, has got settled. In fact, we are now seeing news flows about resolution in some of the suspect companies. All in all, a feel-good factor is coming back into the markets to some extent.


From its recent August lows, the BSE500 is up about 12%. Eicher Motors, Maruti, Chola are up 30% to 40%. Are markets already pricing in, not an incremental recovery but a good recovery? Are markets running ahead of themselves?It is not fair to take a point-to-point return and say that from the lows, the stocks have moved up this much. But it has to some extent been a beta trade, particularly over the last two-three weeks. Investors who had not been invested, suddenly started to see the merits in investing and jumped into companies which had fallen a lot. 

I would say, selectively some companies have warranted a price rise and we have to be careful but in a lot of other companies, the prices had fallen disproportionately low, compared to their valuations. We continue to be quite optimistic on this space.


Your big call is your firm belief that quality companies will give no low or negative returns for the next five to 10 years. What you are saying is that there is a bubble in the market and it is about to get pricked?I will just put a disclaimer. It is not that all quality stocks will have this or that the overall market is in a bubble, what we are trying to say is that it makes sense to have quality stocks in your portfolio. These are companies which have high ROEs but as all of us have been taught and as it has been proven in the world of investing, ultimately a good stock is a stock which will give you returns. It is not a company which is the best but which might not give you returns.

Also, how do you classify whether a stock is good or not? There are various methodologies to it. You can give a premium to quality but that premium cannot be an infinite premium. A company which can trade at 30 PE, starts to trade at 40 and then 50 and then 60 and then 70! There has to be some place, where you start to say that now you have reached a scenario, a valuation metrics from where you cannot make returns. This report is just highlighting those few stocks where PEs have moved up like 70-80 times on a trailing basis and we are just trying to use various analysis tools to justify that if they continue to grow at the rates which they have grown over the last 5-10 years, it is going to be very tough to make any money. If you have a view that some of these companies might grow really fast, then it is a separate thing, but if they continue to grow at the same rate, then it is going to be very tough to make money in this.


We are in a very differentiated global environment. Interest rates are low, growth is not very great, the hunt for yield is very high. What makes you convinced that the trend will not extend for another two-three years?The risk will always be there, I would again go back for people who have been investing in the equity markets in may be two-three decades. We have had many such instances even during the dot-com bubble. The bubble lasted for may be a year or two and Warren Buffett very publicly said that he did not understand it and he did underperform for two-three years. 

The same thing happened in the power and infra side in India where from 2006 to 2008, you are almost in a bubble territory, where the moment you announced the power plant, your market cap is to go up by a couple of billion dollars. Recently, we had this kind of phenomena even in the pharma sector in 2016, where companies targeted to trade at 40-50 PE multiples on a forward basis. We have seen what has happened and so these risks will always be there. 

As an investor what we are basically looking at is whether you have reached a stage where the risk reward is definitely not in your favour. Now you can go wrong for three months, six months, one year... that can always happen because there are a lot of factors other than fundamentals which drive equity prices. These could be technical factors, presence of flows and so on. The risk is always there and the idea of the study is to make people aware that you have to keep this in the back of your mind, before you take a big call.


One of the reasons why some of these staples or engineering companies or the quality companies have done well is because growth has been very volatile for those who made a case of economic recovery in 2015-16-17-18 even 2019 and got it wrong. High frequency data indicates that the economy is not going to revive in a hurry. If the economy is not supportive, shouldn’t one be better off buying a 15% compounder rather than buying a multibagger?There are two-three aspects to it; one is any equity investor who has to be optimistic and positive about the economy. If the view is that the economy is not going to come back to a 6-7-8% growth rate, than anyway India’s PE multiple will deflate. 

Second, you talked about these companies growing at 15% plus very consistently but that is exactly where the surprise is. If you go back the last nine years where the nominal GDP growth in India has been 13% because inflation was almost 6-7%, these companies have grown below the nominal GDP growth rate. 

Now with inflation at 3%, it is very hard to believe that the nominal GDP growth in India over the next 5-10 years is going to be over 10%. In that kind of a scenario, these companies are logically not going to grow higher than the nominal GDP growth. Some companies might do it but as a basket it looks very tough. 

Third, we believe the economy will rebound. It might take two-three months, but we are very optimistic that the economy should come back on its growth trail and once that happens, other companies and sectors will start to demonstrate some stable and faster growth. This is where the investors would start to move from some defensives to companies which are growing faster. This happens all the time in markets.

The most important thing is we have done an analysis globally and there have been no instances in the world where so many companies have traded at more than 50 PE for more than five years. In the US, over the last 15 years there have been only three companies which have traded more than 50 times PE for more than five years and these are companies like Amazon and some of biochem companies. It looks very tough that this outperformance can continue for a long, long time. 


I was reading a report from Howard Marks a couple of days ago and he said that bubbles happen in quality companies also. In the 1960s and 1970s, US blue chip stocks reached a disproportionate territory where they did not make money. It is not that just because it is a quality business, it will always make money for investors.If that would have been the case, portfolio managers would not be needed. You just buy the top 10 best quality companies and just forget about it. I think it works, but even in India, we get carried away by a few of these companies but there have been multiple examples where some of these quality names have disappointed big time. 

The largest pharma company Sun Pharma, from 2016 till now, is down 60%. There have been other companies across sectors — on the FMCG side and also companies like Schneider and Alstom on the engineering side. There have been FMCG companies where the moment you have two-three quarters of slowdown, you had the massive pull-down as far as prices were concerned. In auto the same thing has happened. So once the growth comes, you start to extrapolate that this is going to be there forever and in a lot of these companies, you have one or two or three quarters of disappointment. That is when the investor start to realise that you are paying too high a premium for so called faster growth.

We have understood where the valuations are. Now let us understand what is available. According to your 
analysis, the combined profit of HUL and Nestle is available. The peak profit is about Rs 7,600 crore. The current market cap is about Rs 6 lakh crore. In Rs 6 lakh crore, currently you are getting the entire steel, metal the cement sectors. The combined profit for the metal, cement and steel sectors was Rs 70,000 crore plus. What are you indicating here?It is just to reflect that what can you buy. If Hindustan Lever were to stop operations in India, you would have to shift to some other soaps or some other detergents or some other shampoos but it is not going to be the end of life. But for one Hindustan Lever, you are able to buy almost the entire core sector in India."
3,2019-11-06,Nestle,"Individual investors, including high networth ones, are seeking comfort in blue chips as the broader market has turned volatile.

The total number of individual shareholders in Nifty50 constituent companies increased to 2.33 crore as of September end, 2019 from 2.23 crore on June 30 and 2.16 crore as of March 31,.

As options dried up elsewhere in the market, these investors went for heavy buying in select Nifty stocks, trying to make the most of a market rebound. That, even when valuations of many of these stocks hit sky-high levels.

For instance, Bajaj Finance hovered at a price-to-earnings multiple of 51 times and a price-to-book value of 3.10 times on November 1 after the scrip jumped 130 per cent since December end, 2017.

Nestle India traded at a P/E of 85.40 against the industry average of 49.20. Its price-to-book value stood at 15 times on November 1. The stock has rallied 93 per cent in 22 months to trade around Rs 7,700. Nestle became a part of Nifty on September 27, 2019.

Are these valuations justifiable?

Sunil Singhania-led Abakkus Asset Management in a recent report, titled ‘The Big Call-Bubble in Quality?’ said some of the quality stocks have now reached the bubble zone and could give zero or negative returns over the next few years.

With over 22 lakh small shareholders, 10 per cent of Nifty’s individual investors were holding Reliance Industries, the country’s biggest firm by market value. The stock jumped nearly 60 per cent to Rs 1,457 on November 1 from Rs 921.10 on December 29, 2017. The domestic equity market has remained highly volatile during this period following Sebi’s reclassification of market-caps for mutual funds, credit crisis in the NBFC sector, general elections, unfavourable announcements in the Union Budget 2019, bleak macroeconomic data and adverse global cues.

More than 10 lakh retail investors held SBI, Yes Bank and Tata Motors shares each as of September 30. Yes Bank and Tata Motors shares have cracked more than 50 per cent since December 2017, while country’s biggest lender by assets SBI has largely been flat.

ITC, Infosys, ICICI Bank, Tata Steel, TCS, HDFC Bank and Coal India were among other players in which more than 6 lakh individuals held a stake at the end of September quarter, 2019.

IDBI Capital Markets in October maintained a ‘buy’ call on HDFC Bank with a price target of Rs 1,490. Among other largecap players, Emkay Global Financial Services is ‘overweight’ on Bharti Airtel, Britannia, Grasim, ICICI Bank, Maruti Suzuki, M&M, RIL and United Breweries.


Tables: Number of individual shareholders in Nifty companies
 
 
Among other ‘expensive’ Nifty stocks, industry heavyweights TCS, HUL, RIL, Bajaj Finserv, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Titan Company, ICICI Bank, Britannia, Axis Bank and UPL are among other stocks whose P/Es hovered above their respective industry average as of November 1, 2019.

The P/E ratio measures the relationship of a stock price with its earnings per share.

Analysts say stock investing is never only about financials and there are always some qualitative and future growth aspects to it. “Every valuation methodology has one underlying principle: the value paid today should be justifying future earnings potential,” Abakkus said in a report.

The domestic money manager listed HUL, Maruti Suzuki, Asian Paints, Nestle India, Titan, Siemens, Berger Paints and ABB among 27 perceived high-quality expensive stocks, where profit after tax and revenue growth stood at a CAGR of 11 per cent and 12 per cent, respectively, in past nine years (See Table).

“We don’t think anywhere in the world at any point of time, companies have traded at P/Es of 50-100 for 10-15 years stretch,” Abakkus said in the report.



It said penetration levels of most of the products these companies produce are much higher today than what they were 9-10 years back, and hence, the growth over the next few years should be lower than what it was over the past few years.

On the other hand, the number of investors in the BSE Smallcap index stocks remained almost stagnant in last three quarters at 4.23 crore.

The number of individual shareholders in BSE Midcap index companies increased marginally to 1.37 crore at the end of September quarter from 1.36 crore at the end of the preceding quarter, data available with Ace Equity showed on November 1. The figure stood at 1.34 crore on March 31, 2019.

Analysts see more comfort in the second-rung stocks, which have been beaten down badly over the past 22 months. The BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices have cracked 17 per cent and 30 per cent, respectively, between January 1, 2018 and October 31, 2019.

Harsha Upadhyaya, CIO- Equity, Kotak AMC, says midcap and smallcap stocks are clearly giving more relative valuation comfort and that is where you will end up making more money than the largecaps over the medium to long term.

“We have been suggesting that investors should increase a little bit of allocation towards midcap and smallcap stocks. Even in our portfolios, wherever the investment mandate allows, we have been buying midcaps and smallcaps from across sectors,” he told ETNOW during an interaction."
4,2019-11-07,Nestle,"Some of the real estate companies would benefit from the government moves, but it is not the time to get carried away and just buy any stock, says Devang Mehta, Head, Equity Advisory, Centrum India. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


Do you think there is reason to get excited about owning realty stocks on the back of the steps announced by the finance minister last evening?Whatever was done yesterday augurs very well for real estate sector. It is more of a relief package rather than a stimulus. Probably a lot of real estate players and home buyers who were stuck would find relief out of this measure. Would all the realty stocks rally from here on? Yes, but to me, the proxy plays would be more important. 

A lot of banks which were already stuck in a lot of such projects which were 50% complete and were about to be declared as NPA or have been declared as NPA. There would be more beneficiaries — some banks, lots of NBFCs, PSU banks, building materials as a sector — all will benefit more. Some of the real estate companies would benefit but as I said, it is not the time to get carried away and buy any type of stocks. 

Stay in the fundamentally great stocks, companies which were not getting relief out of this, would get a little bit of earnings momentum from here on. It will take its own sweet time, three months, six months down the line. However, the structure is not yet finalised and it is not time to get carried away but to buy only the time tested ones.


Do you think chasing stocks for all those who have missed out, still makes sense?The rally has been too fast and furious for a lot of people to digest this type of earnings or rather market momentum. One gets a ‘left out’ feeling among a lot of participants. It is sort of liquidity driven, as foreign investors have started to invest in the last three-four weeks. The sense here is that the market has actually not been led only by liquidity, but is also the revival of earnings. A lot of people had written off the second quarter earnings expecting a washout, but that has not been the case. There are a lot of green shoots as well.

My sense is that this rally is driven not only by liquidity but also by bit of fundamentals and a glimpse of economic recovery which will take place via monetary and fiscal stimulus where RBI is cutting rates and also government has started taking a lot of steps in the last two-three months. So yes, there is some juice left to the rally. Of course, nobody knows if in the shorter term, there can be 200-300 point rally here on, but the sense is that it is more a buy-on-dips market rather than a sell-on-rise. Every dip has to be accumulated to buy fundamentally good stocks. 


 Is Titan one of those stocks one should buy on every decline or does a 10% decline not make it a value buy yet?There are two answers. If you ask whether it is a value buy, the answer is no, it is not a value buy. Rather, it is a buy or an accumulator because what we have seen that there are a handful of such stocks in India, maybe 15-20 stocks like Nestle or Titan, or even something like Bajaj Finance or Finserv. These are normally very common plays and it is cliché to talk about them. 

In the case of Titan, these were quarterly number and a guidance which people knew about, but the management came out and straight forward talked about cutting the guidance from 20% to around 11%. It does not hamper the prospects of a company which has been at the forefront of all these businesses. So my view is yes, if you get another 5-7% correction, you should start accumulating Titan if you want to construct a portfolio for the next two-three years. 

One quarter can still be a dampener but that can again be used as a trenching out opportunity. We would be buyers in this type of businesses where consumption can remain the centrifugal theme in the market for some time to come.


Today we will have results of Sun Pharma, UPL coming out. What is going to be on your radar? In pharma, we have been big fans of MNC pharma companies with high market shares, the foreign player doing a lot of capex. It can be companies like Abbott Laboratories or Pfizer or Sanofi. All these companies have done fantastically well, particularly Abbott Laboratories which we have been buying since last one, one and a half years. We see no reason why this trend will not continue. 

So, rather than playing the Indian pharma story or the generic story, we have been more active on the MNC pharma side. A sort of recovery was indicated in the numbers of Cipla as well as some other numbers. Probably there is a trend which will bottom out in the generic companies as well. But we are not yet very aggressive buyers over there. 


Would you say the pain is in the price and at 7000 plus levels, would you be a buyer in Maruti?It is a good hold. The price movement in the auto stocks and particularly in Maruti, has been a little far ahead of expectations. The last couple of months have seen a good demand recovery, and not entirely due to the festive season. There were a lot of discounts available before the BS-VI sets in. So, in that sense, the price movement in auto is a little uncomfortable in the shorter term, But then, the correction had been a sort of carnage. It is a good hold at this time. 

Let us monitor the auto sales numbers for November and December, where one needs to realise that the festive season demand will be over, but whether the sustainability of a normal course of sales which Maruti used to do last year is achieved or not, will be a key monitorable and already the management is guiding towards lower growth. The stock would react a little bit on that and for that it could be a good hold and after monitoring for the next couple of months, a conclusive call can be taken on Maruti. 


When it comes to some of the FMCG majors like HUL and Marico, the commentary is not boding well despite whatever we may be seeing on the stock price. What would be your call on some of the FMCG names?The market was factoring in a disastrous set of numbers from a lot of companies not only FMCG; but even in some of the blue-eyed boys like paint stocks, the management commentary is not very optimistic. The numbers also disappointed to the extent that the market was expecting, Dabur talked about headwinds which have emerged from the lack of demand or demand being low but the numbers did not show that type of behaviour if you analyse these numbers. The sense here is that FMCGs could still be bought selectively. 

If the market needs to go above from here, there is a lot of interest in the consumption related stocks, building material stocks and paints stocks. There is a demand for the top 50-70-80 companies in India. I do not see any reason for people to sell this off if other companies start doing well in these 15-20-25 good businesses and this portfolio probably would do very well over the longer term."
7,2019-11-08,Nestle,"While the rating agencies are talking about us today, the markets are looking ahead and talking about tomorrow, says Srinivasan Subramanian, Managing Director, Investment Banking, Axis Capital. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

What do you make of the Moody’s downgrade of India’s outlook from stable to negative? India is in the same bracket as Bulgaria, Colombia, Indonesia and the Philippines?We all know that the rating agencies do their job a little later and look into the rear view mirror while markets are looking ahead. That is the fundamental difference.


So, you will not pay too much attention to what the rating agencies have to say?I am not being flippant and I am not downplaying the gravity of the situation in India now. The situation is reasonably dire as the first quarter GDP numbers came out. The second quarter numbers are going to be broadly in the same range as the first quarter numbers. However, what the market is looking at positively is that the government is responding at multiple levels across the entire spectrum and not just in terms of corporate rate cuts or what they announced the day before in terms of getting the real estate sector out of the jam. It seems the government is saying that the economy is important and they will focus on it. It may take a couple of quarters for the effect of all these measures to come through. While the rating agencies are talking about us today, the markets are talking about us tomorrow.


But in the near term, do you feel there are challenges or would you say that we are out of the woods, those August slows are way behind us and we will not get back to those kind of lows in the near term at least?The bottom has been made. It will take a couple of quarters for us to completely get out of the woods. On the consumption part of it, we would expect the auto companies to pass on some of the tax rate cuts they will benefit from. They have been having excellent ROEs over the longer term. On a core ROE basis, many of the companies are in the 25-30% plus. If they come to 20% levels, they can pass on further price cuts and that is going to help revive demand. The bottom is done. I do not think we will go further below this, however, it might take a couple of quarters for everything to gather stream.


The high frequency data is still mixed. I can argue about Amazon and Flipkart sales doing well, but car companies are saying they are feeling the heat because of the BS IV emission norms and there is a drop. Mall footfalls have been strong but apparel and food companies are complaining of a very muted Diwali. Which data point will tell us the true picture of where the economy, earnings and the markets are headed?The data point to look at is the sales across different industries. Flipkart alone does not give you the sense; neither does the Maruti sales alone give you the sense. In broader market you will see consumption staples moving up a little quicker and pricing falls come through.


How should one understand what is the right price to pay for some of these great businesses like a Bajaj Finance or Asian Paints or an HDFC Bank? These are the companies where growth is. They have done exceptionally well in a difficult environment. What is your view on this very popular debate on D-Street right now — value versus growth, quality vs premium?It is not an either- or scenario. The Indian markets, over a long period of time, has paid for growth. So growth at a reasonable price is what one should look at. It is easy to talk about HDFC Bank and Bajaj Finance and say that they are very expensive. Bajaj Finance. post the fundraise is around seven times current year and probably six times in FY21. However, on a PE basis, both Bajaj Finance as well as HDFC Bank are at less than 1x PEG and that is an important element to look at it. Have these companies been able to grow their earnings and keep the quality of assets intact? I would not look at earnings for companies in the financial sector, if the asset quality was not good. But these two companies have been able to show that irrespective of market cycles, they have been able to contain risk and the asset quality to the best of their assets. So, I would look at that. 

Asian Paints on the other hand, on a PEG basis, is significantly higher than 1. Therefore I ask myself, if I invest in Asian Paints, what is my ROE (and not the company’s ROE) on the price I pay? I am starting to ask myself those questions and for us, the good quality private banks, companies like Bajaj Finance are all still in the buy zone, However, if you take a company like Asian Paints, Nestle or HUL, in the long term, does it give me an IRR at the level from where I invest or in the next five years-seven years even if it take a longer turn? 

Unless the revenue jump is going to be significantly larger, I might end up getting a single digit IRR and do I want to own companies, however, good are, if they have single digit IRRs? But in Bajaj and HDFC, I see double digit IRRs — 15, 17, 18% stock price IRRs over the next three, four, five and even a longer horizon.


Isn’t there a similar concern with some of the insurance plays as well? The growth and the price multiples that these stocks are trading at, are just not coinciding. Is it time to take chips off the table when it comes to insurance? There has been a very strong runup in the entire cluster and can these kind of growth multiples go on in the near term?The reason why the market is extremely positive about the insurance sector and I should caution you that right now — as Axis Capital we cover only SBI Life Insurance, we do not have coverage on the others — but on a generic basis, the runway for growth for the insurance sector is extremely strong over the next 10-15-20 years. The same is the case with asset management companies. 

On paper these look highly valued but is there is an extremely long runway for growth for these sectors and companies? Definitely, yes and that is the price which the market is willing to give for growth. The Indian market is a growth-oriented play, it is not necessarily a value play, For growth at a reasonable price, one should look at India.


What is your thought when it comes to the auto space? Would you prefer auto ancillaries or prefer to look at the sector in a different way?I would rather play auto through the auto ancillaries because there are some good quality auto ancillaries which are able to get an increasing wallet share. While auto growth is cyclical and will pick up after the disaster in the first six, eight months, I would rather play it through the ancillaries because I am still not sure over a five, seven-year period how the EV is going to impact the existing ones. The ancillaries that are not going to be impacted by the IC engines going off are the ones I would like to be working with."
8,2019-11-08,Nestle,"New Delhi: FMCG major Nestle India on Friday reported 33.46 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 595.41 crore for the third quarter ended September 2019, on higher domestic sales growth and lower tax outgo.

The index has more or less witnessed indecisive formations for the last six sessions.


Moody’s cuts India’s outlook to negative
Moody's changed India's outlook to negative from stable while affirming India’s Baa2 ratings. Moody's says decision to change India's outlook partly reflects lower government, policy effectiveness at addressing economic, institutional weaknesses.

Funding for single housing project cappedFunding from the Rs 25,000-crore special window for stalled housing will be capped at Rs 400 crore for a single project, the government said on Thursday, urging home buyers to pay their remaining dues to enable early completion. The government clarified the “positive net worth” condition for projects to be eligible for support from the alternate investment debt fund in a list of frequently asked questions (FAQs) that it issued on Thursday. The fund won’t provide assistance to projects that are in the Supreme Court and high courts but will take up those being heard by NCLT, it said.


US, China agree on Phase I tariff rollbackChina and the United States have agreed to roll back tariffs on each others’ goods in a “phase one” trade deal if it is completed, officials from both sides said on Thursday, sparking division among some advisers to President Donald Trump. The Chinese commerce ministry, without laying out a timetable, said the two countries had agreed to cancel the tariffs in phases. A US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the rollback would be part of the first phase of a trade agreement that is still being put to paper for Trump and President Xi Jinping to sign.


AGR dues may rise 10%, delay spectrum saleIndia’s mobile phone companies may be liable to pay around 10% more in dues to the government than previously estimated, following the Supreme Court verdict on adjusted gross revenue (AGR), said government officials with knowledge of the matter. The total dues, pegged at Rs 1.3 lakh crore by the telecom department, could rise further on account of changes to the definition of AGR and the levies having to be calculated for the entire period till date. That could delay auctions of spectrum even further, considering the precarious financial situation of the sector,


Window for NBFCs likely under insolvency lawThe government is mulling a special window to address debt woes of stressed non-banking financial companies under the insolvency law, reports PTI.

Troubles at DHFL and scam perpetrated at PMC Bank have added to the woes. Currently, resolution of stressed financial institutions cannot be taken up under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).


Stop predatory pricing: Goyal tells e-comm cosCommerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal has warned ecommerce companies of strict action if they don’t halt predatory pricing on their platforms, flouting foreign direct investment (FDI) rules, said officials with knowledge of the matter.

CBDT notifies PAN-Aadhaar interchangeabilityThe apex body for direct taxes has amended over 100 forms and returns to provide for interchangeability between permanent account number (PAN) and Aadhaar number.A notification to this effect was issued by the Central Board of Direct Taxes on Thursday.

However, an amendment to give effect to this change in various forms or returns and statements prescribed was pending.


Anti-subsidy duty on copper wire rods likelyIndia may impose anti-subsidy duty for a period of five years on copper wire rods from Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam after concluding a probe that these imports have impacted domestic players. The commerce ministry's investigating arm Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) in September last year started a probe into an alleged subsidisation of exports of 'continuous cast copper wire rods' by these four countries.


Farm Ministry aims for ‘zero edible oil import’The commerce ministry has asked the agriculture ministry to prepare a road map for India to attain self-sufficiency in edible oil production. The need for a “zero edible oil import” plan was discussed by commerce minister Piyush Goyal at an inter-ministerial meeting on Tuesday. India spends over Rs 70,000 crore to import about 15 MT edible oil to meet its annual requirement of 25 MT, making it one of the biggest buyers of the cooking medium."

9,2019-11-11,Nestle,"One of the big learnings for us was in terms of formulating an internal methodology to protect our profits. if I look at our own portfolios in the last couple of years, we were sitting on humongous profits in a number of midcap names, says Nitin Raheja, Co-Founder, AQF Advisors. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


What are you tracking in the broader markets? Any themes that are standing out?Clearly this is a bottom-up market because a couple of factors are holding. There are these so-called quality names and people are ready to pay any sort of premium for those names. So, either you have one strategy where you are sitting there but beyond a particular level you find it hard to justify to yourself in terms of putting more money to work in stocks at that price level. This is a bottom up market yet. For example, let us take the CNX 500 and I am not going to talk about profit growth because that has got aberrated by the tax cuts. But if you take the overall numbers, sales have grown 5% for about 352 companies that have declared numbers and operating profit has grown about 11%. 

Now that is not great but if you come down granular and start looking at it from a bottom up perspective, there are plenty of opportunities. For example, take the services-oriented businesses. The gas companies declared good numbers. On the entertainment side, the exhibition companies have come up with great numbers. Some of the private banks have shown good numbers. Hospital companies have shown good numbers. So one has to pick and choose and when you have been able to call the sector themes right, you will see the portfolio starting to outperform the index in the last couple of months. That is broadly the direction that we will continue going ahead.


What has been the biggest learning for you?Coincidentally, we were also tracking ourselves and trying to understand what we learnt from the market in the last couple of years and we have seen that in the past. One of the biggest things is not taking your profits. Again, that could mean that at times you could probably lose in some of your big winners. We have been really looking at that aspect in terms of how do we protect profits because even if I look at our own portfolios in the last couple of years, we were sitting on humongous profits in a number of midcap names. 

One of the big learnings that we looked and derived was that we did not adhere to stop losses in certain cases but more importantly, when a stock started correcting from the top, we did not keep it. . There is no accurate method but one of the methods that we found is that where a number of our stocks came near breaching the 200 DMA at least three to four times, those stocks finally breached and there was a change in fundamentals. What typically happens is we discovered prices are leading indicators and very often fundamental numbers continue to look good for two-three quarters before they would fall off, but the prices would start reflecting that far in advance. So one of the big learnings for us was in terms of formulating an internal methodology to protect our profits. We often saw companies, say for example Bajaj Finance breaching that indicator, bouncing back and going back up sharply. These are some of the things that we looked at really.


What is next for a Bajaj Finance, for HDFC Bank, for TCS or for that matter even Nestle which has managed to beat the industry rate of 10% sales growth in the quarter gone by? Has the time come to take some chips off the table when it comes to these top names?It is always a very difficult decision to take and selling is something which most fund managers are not great at. You have 99 books on buying but hardly one book on selling. The point is that some of these companies which had showed consistency will probably see some sort of time correction. You do not really see them coming off the cliff, but I was more specific because some of these largecap names — be it HDFC or Bajaj Finance might get into zones where they might not give you returns for some period of time. That is really the law of normalised returns starting to play into some of these stocks. 

I do not think they have necessarily the time to sell some of those stocks but more specifically, when you look into the broader market and a lot of the midcap names that we have seen out there, you know those cuts can be very sharp and deep. You have often seen most people are getting into these midcap names, ending up making humongous amounts of money. The important thing is how to protect those profits because these so called rich names might give you time corrections, might not perform but they are not going to really see you erode your capital. This becomes more important for the broader rather than the midcap names.


Would you be looking at some of the names that have been bouncing around of late, outside of the ICICIs of the world?We all realised that the next one year is going to be tough and it is going to be a time for the economy to come back. During this period of time, it is very difficult to come up with other names that could come under stress because the likelihood of that happening could be very high. At this point of time, we would speak to some of the larger private banks.

If you go back a few years post the tech bubble crash, we saw that the larger tech companies had a greater possibility of withstanding intermittent shocks of a client going away and so on. Similar examples hold true for banks right now. If you are a small or a mid-sized bank, if there is one account which goes bad, the impact on profitability is far higher vis-à-vis a larger banks which can sustain some of those. We have seen that whether it has been the case with the HDFC Banks of the world or even ICICI Bank. 

I would continue to remain in that because these banks have the capacity to raise capital if these markets go higher and garner more market share vis-à-vis some of the smaller banks. 


What else should we talk about in terms of earnings specifically? Anything from the midcap basket that has surprised you, that you are looking at positively?Across the basket, the cement companies actually showed decent set of numbers. If we look at the cement basket, we saw very healthy growth in their operating profit numbers and again I am not talking of PAT numbers because they were an anomaly. 

The pharma basket which has been an underperformer for a long time, came up with a decent set of numbers. In fact, it could get distorted but among the pharma companies, we saw 133% sales growth and 40% operating profit growth. These were some of the baskets which surprised. Then there were the services entities like the hospital companies, the multiplex companies which did well during the quarter. And of course the gas companies have delivered some excellent set of numbers. So, these are certain businesses which have visibility and which are relatively non-cyclical. Also, they do not really trade at lofty multiples.


Clearly it seems that disinvestment is high on the government’s agenda. Is that a space which is looking attractive?These stocks are going to remain buoyant on hopes of the valuations as far as disinvestment is concerned. Some have already seen a substantial run up and the pricing has got nothing to do with immediate fundamentals. We would rather stick to being with stocks where we see numbers and earnings growth."
10,2019-11-13,Nestle,"New investors are coming in from across the world into the Indian financial services. Also, any number of overseas funds are ready to give last-mile financing and people still do not understand this. This is not equity financing. This is priority financing which will get paid off first but projects will get completed and ghost towns will start looking completed, says N Jayakumar, MD, Prime Securities. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


For the last three years, value proponents like you have been making a case for starting to take some risk, to come out of the shelter of good governance, good return ratios. But those arguments of buying into cyclicals or other stocks which offer deep value and some degree of valuation comfort, have not made money. Should we genuinely move out of these hallowed stocks? My first point is that I do not think the idea is to junk governance and say get into non-governance as a contra call! You must go back to the SEBI directive that we talked about where the concentration of portfolios were in the top 100 and the top 250.


The classification was changed.That is right. What that essentially meant was that the big became bigger as far as market caps are concerned. It also suited the disproportionate rise of stocks like the 60-70 PE stocks which in any case had low floats. They had what I would call career investors -- people who held on to Levers and Nestle for years and never thought it necessary to sell and especially for those who believe that you must stay invested in the markets. This became a better proxy than pulling out and putting money in anything else because most of these investors have remained investors right through. 

What that essentially has meant is that the incremental demand was disproportionate. The stocks kept rising and many of these stocks have had no new issuances. They have had new investors and new money getting allocated repeatedly. I think it created a bubble situation compared to anything else in the world. You could argue about the inflection point. We have been arguing at least for six months now that it is time to move out of the shelter of these stocks because the markets are expanding upwards. We did make a brave call on 10,600 on your show. That was bought in. I had said you have nothing to lose except a fixed deposit rates, go out there and invest right now. And that is the way it has turned out. 

The disproportionate returns given by some of the midcaps in the turnaround has been high. A large private bank where till recently, people were talking about bankruptcy pricing, has given over 100% returns from their bottoms.


Rs 40 has become Rs 72 for YES Bank.We are conflicted in some sense but yes that is a classic case.


Something like RBL also.
 Take RBL, take YES Bank. The thesis actually is much more than just branching out into smaller stocks. The thesis is that there are times in life where the markets tend to be excessively positioned on one side which means in terms of an index people feel that the bottom is going to fall out. We did talk about this exactly two-and-a-half months ago in your show. We said the markets bottom out six months ahead of the economy. The economy is darkest before dawn and really the latest readings of the economy have been really bleak. 

But I am still going out there and saying as I did say three months ago that come January which is approximately six months after the bottom was formed, you will start seeing economic numbers. What will create it? No idea. Is it so very obvious that the markets are telling you that the economy is going to bottom out somewhere December, Jan, February around that time.


What if markets get it wrong? What is it we look back and say look guys this is all liquidity, it is all global allocation. Iit is all what happened with emerging markets and what transpired was we got flows and we got lucky because of the interplay at emerging markets?This is a flip side to it. The economy got killed because of liquidity. Bring back liquidity to the economy. The entire thing has been about how do you transmit money. The government in all fairness has had the right intent, maybe not the right implementation at times because they are also grappling with what exactly to do, how to transmit. The word transmission has been used more often by a finance minister in the first six-eight months than I have ever seen in the history of this country. 

It will take time for the money to transmit but I have been tweeting that the real estate and the NBFC space needs have to be addressed. Why? Because the NBFC gets credit back into the system. The real estate space actually starts monetising the oldest asset as far any Indian is concerned. 


And it has a great multiplier effect on the economy – jobs, infrastructure, the works…It absolutely does. We tweeted about it two weeks ago saying this exactly. Other than the stamp duty cut, virtually everything else that has been talked about has actually come through. This is very different from the past because of three things. One, in the alternate investment fund (AIF), there is an amount being talked about. Two, the cast of characters has been given. And three, it is largely a set of people who got independent charge. This is not going to be monitored by RBI. It is AIF structure and investors will come in the sense that you start the process with say SBI, LIC, etc, putting in Rs 500,000 crore each. 

Any number of overseas funds are ready to give last-mile financing and I think people still do not understand this. This is not equity financing. This is priority financing which will get paid off first but importantly projects will get completed and ghost towns will start looking completed..


And the fisc is not getting compromised. If I recall our last time’s conversation, you said look the fiscal deficit number is sacrosanct and should not be compromised. A corporate tax cut has happened, But despite their admission, acknowledgment and communication that fiscal deficit will not be compromised, Moody’s says there is a problem in the economy. If rating agencies start taking a negative view, it automatically defeats the whole purpose of protecting the fiscal because then bond yields go higher and cost of capital does not go down?I do not want to participate in echo chambers that start lashing out at rating agencies because they are not here to defend their actions. They have done their own analysis. I do not think rating agencies historically have got it completely right, but on various occasions, they probably have got it right too. My own assessment this time is they have got one set of assessment as static and it is kind of dated. I am not a great fan of taking that as a projection of things going on. What is important is in a time when there are event-wise discontinuities in the system, it means that a person whose rating has been downgraded, does not immediately get money, new paradigm in the Indian markets; Two, in the past you would say that HDFC as a AAA would borrow at a particular rate. Somebody with a AA plus would borrow at so and so rate. Even a BBB would get money at a different rate. That particular paradigm is breaking for the moment. Until it comes back, -- I do not think you can use empirical data. 

What you can say is that liquidity finally is the panacea for this. One does not know in what manner or shape or form will liquidity trickle in. That is why we gave a very interesting thing; overseas equity in domestic debt is the marriage you need. No constitution has said no to this and this is what you need to make things happen. It can be seen when a private sector bank attracts a lot of money -- be it family office money, private investor money or fund money.

Our own particular private sector bank is where we are working on raising money, we see this is the kind of investors that are coming in because the world over, banks and financial services are the highest in terms of attracting capital. There is an investor who has actually come out and said treat me as dumb money. I just want the play. I do not need any conditions, I do not need any board seats, I do not need anything. I just need something in an RBI approved limit, 5%, if it is so be it.

So there are different kinds of investors coming in. The traditional PE investors typically come with due diligence and conditions etc. We are seeing a new category of investors coming. 


How many offices are looking at investing in the bank? The Munjals and the Mittals are looking at putting money in Yes Bank?Some of the finest Indian investors including family offices are looking at investing. Whether it is YES Bank or any other bank, without being specific, I am just talking about that the concept of new investors coming in from across the world into the Indian financial services.

This morning I read something about an NBFC getting money into a particular part of another NBFC. So one part is getting financing. It is overseas capital and domestic debt and if you take this theme forward, whether it is completion financing for real estate, all of these themes will play out."
13,2019-11-20,Nestle,"After the threat of organic products from Baba Ramdev-led Patanjali Ayurved, government regulations have the potential to act as another external factor prompting fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies to change. Proposed bans on single-use plastic and on sale of junk foods in school canteens are likely to push companies back to their war rooms to rejig their product portfolios to make them healthier, reduce dependency on plastic and re-strategise their communication.

The Centre has planned to phase out single-use plastics by 2022. Several states, meanwhile, have varyingly banned single-use plastic products. The Food and Standards Authority of India issued draft regulations earlier this month on banning sale as well as advertisements of junk foods (highly fatty and salty foods) in school. Under its ‘Eat Right Movement’, the regulator had last year asked the food and beverage industry to voluntarily reduce salt, sugar and saturated fat in packaged foods. The nudge is now slated to turn into a push.

Consumers are turning more health and environment conscious and such regulatory push is a natural extension of this. FMCG companies, with their predominant use of plastic packaging and packaged food products with high content of salt, sugar and fats have a reason to worry.

The thrust of Patanjali Ayurved on natural and organic products was lapped up by consumers, a trend that gave mainstream FMCG companies a run for their money in the recent past. However, after the initial stress, the companies were able to tide over the threat of competition by introducing natural variants of their products or acquiring herbal or ayurvedic products to complete their portfolios.

Thanks to their global parents, multinational companies such as HUL and Nestle have been agile in knowing which way the wind is blowing now. ITC, with its strong compliance of ESG (environmental, social and governance) norms, too has taken proactive measures.

For HUL, its parent is leading the way. Unilever has announced that by 2025 it will halve its use of virgin plastic in its packaging by using more of recycled plastics and that it will collect and process more plastic packaging than it sells. Nestle too has chalked out measures to reduce the salt and sugar content in its product categories, along with adopting more environment-friendly packaging.

FMCG stocks are largely performing well on the bourses. For investors, companies that adopt a strong and discerning strategy to meet the regulations without compromising on the quality or taste will emerge the winners. Incidentally, the cost of making products healthier and plastic-free will be passed on to consumers as companies continue to premiumise their portfolio."

14,2019-11-20,Nestle,"SBI, Bank of Baroda, Canara Bank and PNB can give at least a 30% upside from present prices, says Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive V-P, IIFL Securities. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

On Aviation StocksThere has been a relative slowdown of the economy but a lot of it is getting addressed. The cost of money is definitely headed lower which means ease in travel and very lucrative rates maybe a thing of the past. Rates may start to head up. We have a buy on both the stocks on declines. There is regular bouts of profit booking which comes when IndiGo was Rs 1m750 and SpiceJet was Rs 145 . But again, these are the two listed companies. Personally, I prefer to travel by Vistara.

But on declines, this is a very consumer centric industry where 2020 should bode extremely well, given that we are very optimistic on the return of the consumer, the economy doing well and aviation as a conduit for that. 


On Telecom
Our clients have been laughing their way to the bank. We have been long on Bharti and Reliance as a disclosure and we are riding it. We think there is going to be a short term bout of profit booking which may last for two-three days but this is one sector which is going to bely most expectations. Most of the underpinnings are over. ARPUs are going to rise and we think there could be a fair package for both Vodafone and Bharti from the government.

We will work on that but we definitely think the government is going to give some relief. On the consumption side, you can see that we have been saying that ARPUs may have bottomed out and we thought that data is definitely going to get more expensive. A disclosure, Bharti, Reliance are two of our top picks. They continue to be in our portfolio and this week has been exceptionally strong for all investors who have held those shares on our account.

We are very positive on Sun, Lupin, Dr Reddy’s, Cipla and Glenmark. You can add a Divy’s there, but if you are a strategic investor, then SBI Pharma Fund and the Nippon Pharma Fund should be very, very good funds to do a SIP at least for the next six months.-Sanjiv Bhasin


On PSU Banks
The weaker or the most hated sectors -- telecom and PSU banks are bouncing back. The Supreme Court judgement on Essar Steel is a path breaking decision and the SBI chairman, smaller banks have said that write backs will be a part of the course as most of the provisioning is done. So, I am extremely positive on PSU banks. There is a Rs 70,000 crore of recapitalisation, which means almost 5.5 lakh crore of book will grow in the next three years.

We think you cannot go wrong given that yields are softening. They are awash with cash and they are going to definitely start the lending cycle on the retail side. So SBI continues to be our top pick. Along with that, Bank of Baroda, Canara Bank and PNB can give you at least a 30% upside from present prices. 2020 may actually see PSU banks lead from the front


On Divestment 
The divestment candidates like Concor, BPCL & SCI have moved up very smartly.We think this is going to be a path breaking reform by the government. Strategic selloff last happened in 1999 and after that there has been a total hiatus. The government has decided that they have no business to be in business and that is a very positive move.

BPCL, Concor and SCI should set the cat amongst the pigeons. We are extremely positive. I think the valuations they will get will also be fairly impressive, given that all three businesses are monopolies. We have to see in the next three months, how fast the divestment takes place. The finance minister has already indicated that they should be done with it before March and it should see re-rating of the entire PSU basket. 

The government has the intension to bring down their holding to 26% in a lot of other companies like IOC and BHEL. These are all very good entry points because the unlocking of value will be huge as and when it takes place.


On Pharma Stocks
Pharma has been a very big underperformer. This is just about time where smart money is seeing rotation. By the way, pharma numbers, particularly the likes of Glenmark were very smart looking and now people have realised that pharma has consolidated enough and the worries of the FDA issues are now going to be on the backburner. Plus, generic pricing in the US may be back and they are spreading in geographies across the world. The local businesses for all of them have looked up so we are very positive on Sun, Lupin, Dr Reddy’s, Cipla and Glenmark. You can add a Divy’s there, but if you are a strategic investor, then SBI Pharma Fund and the Nippon Pharma Fund should be very, very good funds to do a SIP at least for the next six months. 2020 could see pharma hugely outperform as a sector.


On Trends in Consumption SpaceThere are three parts. Firstly, these stocks have been the prime of most of the mutual fund portfolios. Nestle, Lever, Colgate and Asian Paints have taken the cake, even though numbers were not that sparkling. But they have been very expensive stocks and have been getting more expensive. For us, the game changer is these two three events which the government has done -- corporate tax cut, strategic disinvestment. The pass through effect of money where the mistrust is now getting allayed and you should see much easier pass through of money from banks as PSU banks start to lend very actively on all three -- discretionary, staples and durables. 

The broader basket will definitely outperform. We are not making a case for Nestle or Lever at these prices. We think in fact if the Nifty sustains over 12,000 and if we hit new highs which is just round the corner, then the broader market consumption should do extremely well. That means discretionaries like auto and select other FMCG stocks could be outperformers in 2020."
12,2019-11-20,Nestle,"We are buying one of the two-wheeler companies in some of our client’s portfolios says Saurabh Mukherjea, Founder & Chief Investment Officer, Marcellus Investment. Mukherjea also says getting high teens to low 20s returns consistently by buying great compounders is very doable in India. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


There is every reason why one should not buy telecom stocks. In the next 10 minutes, we can find 15 reasons why one should not buy telecom stocks yet Bharti is at a 52-week high. What is going on?I guess there are probably enough people out there who are hoping that that the industry consolidates around two players and Bharti benefits from that from being one of those two players. I do not see any other logical way to understand this other than the fact that a number of investors out there are making a punt that they are in a two-player industry. Bharti will get its fair share of spoils. I cannot give you anything more substantive than that, I am afraid.


Can we imagine our life without power? The answer to that is no. But have shareholders of power companies made money? The answer is “no,” at least in India. Do you think telecom is like power? You need telecom but for minority shareholders, telecom companies will struggle now?Most regulated industries in India are similar -- whether you look at airlines, telecoms, power, infrastructure or real estate. Wherever the regulatory construct is such that the regulator or the government calls the shorts in terms of who gets in, who stays out and what are the rules of the game, it is very difficult for minority shareholders to make any money. That is the rule of thumb I followed in my 11 years in India -- stay away from sectors where the government or the regulator determines the rules of engagement. In such a sector, it is very difficult for minority shareholders to make money be that telecom, power, real estate or airlines.


ETNOW sources seem to be indicating that today the cabinet is going to decide on disinvestment in BPCL, Concor and SCI. Earlier also, the finance minister had indicated that disinvestment process is going to come to a close and she hopes to close in on that by the financial year end. Would you say though that the best is already in the price somewhat?I am not so sure how easy it will be to make money from high quality privatisation plays such as BPCL and Concor. Both are actually very good quality assets but I am not so sure how easy it will be for minority shareholders to make a punt on them and make money. What is more encouraging, what is more upbeat for the generally is that the government is clearly saying that in the next 6-8 months, we will move towards privatisation or large stake sales. That is probably the most bullish step forward towards privatisation we have seen in 14-15 years. The last major privatisation was made by NDA-1, a good 20 years ago. Beyond the stock specifics, this momentum in selling class assets is very encouraging for the market as a whole.


Given the degree of underlying uncertainty in the economy, we are looking for companies where we know with a very high degree of certainty that the books are clean and the numbers are real.-Saurabh Mukherjea


What is the overarching theme that you are going with in the current environment? Is it domestic focussed names, is it valuation? Given the degree of underlying uncertainty in the economy, we are looking for companies where we know with a very high degree of certainty that the books are clean and the numbers are real. 

Secondly, we look for companies where the products are as close as is possible to be essential for day-to-day life in India. We are trying to avoid companies where the product or the purchase is discretionary in nature. 

Third thing is barriers to entry. Clean accounts, essential products are very good to have but you need to have barriers to entry to make sure competition does not come and take your profits away. And when we find such companies we go and buy as proactively as we can without losing sleep on what was the PE multiple yesterday morning, what it will be tomorrow morning. We found in India around 20 such stocks; half are already in our portfolio and hopefully in the next year or so, we might find a couple of more stocks like this. 

As and when the economic environment becomes less hostile, we might become a little bit more adventurous in our stock picking. Over the last couple of years, it has been very tightly defined mantra, clean accounts, essential products, very high barriers to entry.


Sunil Singhania said buying a good business and buying a good stock are two different things. D-Mart is a great company, Indigo is a great company, a classic compounder which you own. Something like Aventis is a great company but if you are buying them at PE multiples of 50, 60, 70, the chances of making double digit returns for next three years are very rare. Do you think those classic compounders which you like and which are based on previous history, return ratios, ROE and ROC, they are outpriced right now?Sunil Singhania is a long-standing a guru, a friend, I have learnt from him in the years to come and we hope to learn a lot from him in the years to come. I learnt from him two years ago as to how to think about setting up an independent asset management business. Sunil is saying if you try to do what we are doing in India and try to do this in America, you will get slaughtered. 

In most efficient markets like the UK, USA, Germany and Japan, it is very difficult to maintain return on capital at 40% or even 30% over an extended period of time. Most glamorous well known American or Japanese firms will have return on capital of barely 15%. If they get to 15%, they will be celebrated on TV channels in America, on the covers of magazines and so on. 

Our country is unique amongst the world’s 10 largest economies in that we are the only large economy which has around 20-25 companies whose ROC is a million miles above their cost to capital for decades on end. When we say million miles, I am saying 40% ROC for a very extended period of time. If you can keep return on capital so far above the cost to capital for an extended period of time, it gives you a mountain of free cash flow and if you keep reinvesting that money in the business (as we have seen in India over the last five, 10, 20 years and even last year), you get a very high chance of keeping earnings growth around 20%-25% mark.

If we take one example of the several in our portfolio, this is exactly what Asian Paints has done for the last 30 years. Asian Paints 20 years ago was trading at exactly the same PE multiple. Asian Paints over the last 20 years has given close to 100 times returns. Nestle 20 years ago was trading at pretty close to the same multiple. Nestle over the last 20 years has given close to 80-90 times your money back. I do not know about the next three weeks or next three months, but I am pretty confident that if we carry on focussing on this type of company with very high barriers to entry, with return on capital being well above the cost to capital, we chug back plenty of free cash flow into the business. Whether you are Asian Paints, Pidilite or Dr Lal Path Labs, you reinvest the free cash flow back into the business. 

In a poor country like ours, the growth potential is immense. Even in a downturn, you are seeing these companies -- Asian Paints, Dr Lal Path Labs and even Page Industries -- which is a big part of our portfolio, give you volume growth between 9% and 19%. That gives you a sense of how far we have to go in terms of development to our country. 

PE-based investing has a big place in everybody’s portfolio. In the west, PE-based investing, value investing as it is better known as, is the definitive way to manage money by and large. It works in India as well. There is a small set of companies in our country which are able to keep return on capital very high and thus earnings growth is very high and if there you invest even at 100 times PE shown over the last three years and in my books I have shown over the last 20 years you still make very healthy returns, high teens, low 20s returns. 

If I make high teens, low 20s returns for our clients consistently, that is a pretty decent outcome for them. We are not claiming we can do 30-40% return by timing the market or by getting the PE multiples right, but high teens to low 20s consistently by buying great compounders is very doable in India.


You are completely staying away from power, metals, real estate pockets. If we do see an overall pullback which we have already started to see when it comes to the market regardless of the fundamentals or growth indicators, do you see more participation across the board?The most interesting one will be auto and as we all know October has been a pretty decent month for the auto sector where everybody is trying to figure out whether October is the beginning of the auto revival or whether it is a flash in the pan. What we have started to do in some of our client’s portfolio is, selectively buy one of the two-wheeler companies. I am not at liberty to disclose the name but we are buying one of the two-wheeler companies in some of our client’s portfolios not because we expect the two-wheeler revival to have begun a month ago and from now on it will grow, but given the quality of the franchise, the high ROCs, high cash generation the sheer quality of the corporate governance, we felt that the two-wheeler company was just too deliciously cheap to be ignored. 

We will see if the two-wheeler company carries on showing us that even with low volume growth they can hold up their business, you might buy some more. I am not so sure cars and trucks are going to recover quite as quickly as two-wheelers. I think two-wheelers are likely to recover quicker than cars and trucks because their ticket sizes or purchase are smaller. But this is probably the biggest sector if one wanted to play a potential economic recovery. More than cement, steel or real estate, two-wheelers and the auto would be the industry to look at. There are several good auto ancillaries which are absolutely smashed in terms of valuation. Again, these are cash generative companies with strong balance sheets. So, auto, auto ancillaries would be my favourite play on economic recovery as and when we get visibility on that."

BSE on Friday announced some changes to the composition of its flagship Sensex. The exchange has decided to remove Tata Motors, Tata Motors DVR, YES Bank and Vedanta from the index to make space for UltraTech Cement, Titan and Nestle India. This will be effective from December 23.

YES Bank has been one of the biggest disappointments in recent months as far as the stock market performance is concerned. It has dived 65 per cent year-to-date. SImilarly, Tata Motors is down 4 per cent YTD, Tata Motors DVR (17.9 per cent) and Vedanta (28 per cent) in comparison of 13 per cent gain in Sensex.


FPIs bullish on India

Foreign investors poured over Rs 5,000 crore into the Indian equity market on Friday, as per data available on NSDL. Net inflows in the last week was at Rs 2,683.96 crore. Overall, FIIs have largely been bullish on the Indian market in November, investing Rs 17,548 crore.


Asian markets

A cautious rally in Asian markets also buoyed domestic stocks. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan bounced 0.7 per cent, after losing 0.4 per cent last week. Japan's Nikkei firmed 0.7 per cent, while Australian stocks rose 0.5 per cent and Shanghai blue chips 0.3 per cent. Heng Seng also gained1.5 per cent. Most European markets also opened with gains. FTSE added 0.7 per cent while CAC gained 0.6 per cent and DAX was up 0.5 per cent. 


Technical factor

Nifty50 appears to have embarked on a fresh leg of rally as it erased the last two sessions of losses witnessed from the highs of 12,038-11,883 levels in just one stroke, said Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in.

Hence, sustaining above 11,919 it should ideally test its life time highs placed around 12103. But beyond that in best case scenarios we can expect a target of 12350-400 levels. One can continue to retain a positive outlook as long as Nifty sustains above 11919 levels which can be ideal stop for fresh long positions on closing basis."
20,2019-11-25,Nestle,"New Delhi: Shares of Yes Bank fell nearly 2 per cent on Monday after announcement that it will be dropped from BSE benchmark Sensex from December 23.

23,2019-11-26,Nestle,"Foreigners have brought in more money and the rally has started. Some corrections cannot be ruled out because valuations have started scaling up. In that correction, stay with good quality stocks, says Deven R Choksey, MD, KR Choksey Investment Managers. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.



Whether you call this a Santa rally or picking up from where we left off, we took maybe two to three weeks off in the middle. Now it looks like market momentum is intact. What are you making of it?I stay selective in my investment portfolio. I do agree that the current rally is largely propelled by the liquidity coming in from the global side and that too in select few stocks, where they matter most as far as the index is concerned. It is not across the board. Though definitely one would argue that in the respective sectors, selective stocks have started performing well in this particular rally, it is a good sign that it is merit driven. 

Now whether it will come off in a hurry, I do not know. My reading says that we are heading for relatively better times. Everybody wants to look forward to US and India signing some kind of trade treaty, wherein Indian exports would start looking up. That could signal probably a larger level of interest as far as the global investors are concerned into our market.

I guess the foreigners have brought in more money and the rally has started. Maybe some corrections cannot be ruled out because the valuations have started scaling up. In that correction, my recommendation would be to stay with good quality stocks and corrective downside should be bought into in building the portfolio henceforth. We remain relatively confident about the market momentum on the upside for next year. Our bet would be on quality stocks.


What has been your big acquisition in October-November, where have you added a substantial amount of weight to your portfolio?We saw some amount of downside in HDFC and that gives us relatively more confidence to buy further into the stock. The company has a housing loan book which is probably one of the best in the industry. At the same time, the investments into the listed companies within the group including the bank AMC, the life insurance companies and also some of the yet to monetise businesses like Ergo are there. 

Among them, a few NBFCs from education companies, particularly NBFC side is among the themes which we picked up. We felt that this is one area where we could remain relatively safe in adding into the portfolio. We continue to add more weight into Reliance largely because we believe that consumer facing businesses -- Jio and retail would eventually get monetised. That is where unlocking of the valuation would take place and the benefit would go to the investors and shareholders. 

These are the areas where we have stayed focussed. We have not added midcaps and smallcaps. However, we like some of them and continue to hold them. We feel the larger ones would become bigger and they are going to create much bigger opportunity going forward. That is the theme that we are following currently.


It is a print of new all-time high on the Nifty. The global markets are also at an all-time high, as are we. Is it the start and the end of the story that there is nothing special about India? Last one month NASDAQ is up 4%, we are also 4% up. Should we stop complaining about the slowdown?Globally, few things are probably propelling this rally in equity. One of them is definitely the important aspect that the rate of interest is historically low in most of the countries. 


We have not added midcaps and smallcaps. However, we like some of them and continue to hold them.-Deven R Choksey
As a result, the funds had shifted to long-term asset growth like equity. That is one definite allocation perspective that one brings in. The second most important perspective that one brings in is that America and China are settling the trade row and as a result, prospects are brightening.

2020 is being seen as a year wherein we are likely to see relatively stable trade as a result of which, investors once again come back to the market with higher allocation of funds. Coming to India, in October and November, we have been seeing a good flow of money from FIIs. That is also propelling this particularly rally. 

From the indices’ perspective per se, some of the larger weight stocks are basically driving this rally. Reliance is one among them. Even a telecom company like Bharti Airtel is among them. At the same time, the HDFC and Bajaj twins are basically driving the markets and the indices up. The overweight of some of these stocks is basically driving the indices up. Overall, the midcaps and smallcap are still languishing. In select stocks, we have been seeing the buying coming from select corners but otherwise, markets are looking relatively stable. 


Yesterday we broke the story on government considering one-time rollover of debts. . Do you think a move like this could help ease the problems for the real estate space?It is a very positive move on structural side. This is where you are likely to see stress. Real assets are getting the breathing space and more money would come in to buy some of the properties which these realty companies particularly have been nurturing for some time. My reading says that if this activity gains momentum, probably we would be seeing a very strong emergence of paper use model and that is going to probably revive the real estate market.

Currently, real estate businesses are becoming prohibitively expensive for consumer and that is where the financers’ role is going to be very important. With the kind of structured vehicle that the government has built, it is going to have the potential of inviting more money into the system, particularly from the global side. We remain relatively confident about it. I do not know which company would get immediate benefits, but strong companies with good properties would probably have a better outlook to talk about going forward. 


You mentioned Reliance and of course that has been in focus. Let us also take a look at the telecom angle at some of the other teleco names, Bharti in particular. We have been going through some trends and the kind of move that it has made, is really standing out. What is your perspective on Bharti?The moratorium on AGR is going to help Bharti along with the other companies in the telecom sector. So, that creates a breathing space. At the same time, tariff is going up from 1st December. That is likely to spell out good news as far as the working of the company is concerned. 

If I am right, we could possibly see around 20-25% increase in the tariff. You could see a similar contribution coming into the EBITDA of the company. I think these are two positive news that I see. Alongside, there is one challenge and that is a challenge of putting in the 5G related bandwidth and the infrastructure in the business. So, that will need more capital and so capital infusion will have to take place. That is one challenge which one will have to look out for.

Otherwise, in current times, the stock probably he has been experiencing buying also because of the fact that I think in last few years telecom story was sounded negative now I think it is slightly stable comparatively so that is why I think you are seeing the Bharti going up. I do not think that I think the company’s financial ratios would change big time from here. They continue to operate in the single digit of ROC. That will not be changing beyond a point, even though an increase in tariff will take place, given the kind of pressure that they would have on the expansion side.


We have often debated about whether or not quality is overpriced. Has the time now come to ease off from some of these blue chip names? Would you believe that Nestle has a problem ahead because of the slowdown in the milk market?Well not as much honestly, if I start looking at the overall composition of the market and the purchasing power therein. Most of the FMCG companies are sitting on the brilliant prospect of finding themselves in a better position because of greater purchasing power in the hands of consumers, particularly the rural ones. We are definitely expecting to see more money in the hands of people, largely because of the rollout of the projects by the government and infrastructure projects.

At the same time, the favourable monsoon and the resultant outcome on the crops would spell out better times for the rural economy. Going forward, the FMCG company and food sector in particular should be in a favourable position. Having said that on the prospect side, companies and their valuations have always been challenging. They have been quoting at a premium.

If you buy any of the FMCG companies, they have probably priced in things for next two years. You should not be expecting any return out of them. On the contrary. you should be buying these companies if you want to have them in the portfolio, by doing an SIP into this kind of stocks. You are never going to get it cheaper and at the same time at least two years of prices are discounted fully at the current price level. The same story holds true for companies like Nestle, Britannia and many other companies in the FMCG basket. These are expensive but they have better prospects going forward."

25,2019-11-27,Nestle,"Rather than looking at largecaps or midcaps as a basket, it is a very stock specific market, says Pankaj Pandey, Head Research, ICICIdirect.com. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


How should one read into the YES Bank news? Three months ago, there was a big question mark on whether the bank would survive or not. But if they indeed raise capital, they will survive. The problem is that the stock today is in F&O band. What should one do?We would expect some bit of short covering on YES Bank, but from a fundamental perspective we have not really rated the stock because the stock is under review. Earlier we had a reduce rating on the stock. Our sense is that beyond $1.2 billion, the bank would need more funds and that would lead to good amount of dilutions. Till the time you do not have clarity in terms of the extent of funds being raised, we would not be chasing this stock structurally. From a shorter-term perspective, a bit of short covering can drive the stock performance.


According to Citibank today the divergence between largecap stocks and midcap stocks now is at a historic high. Could it remain like this for a long time? After midcap stocks started correcting in 2009, they came back in fashion only in 2013. As of now, midcap stocks have only corrected for two-two and a half years. Are we in for a long winter for mid and small cap stocks?Rather than looking at largecaps or midcaps as a basket, it is a very stock specific market. The index multiple is going up because the index has high multiple PE stocks. So, again it is a very stock specific market. We have seen cracks in largecaps also. We have seen very good performance from tier one companies and same is the case with even midcaps and smallcaps. My sense is wherever there is comfort on growth, the market has been giving robust multiples to a number of companies -- be it largecap, midcap or smallcap. 

For example, ITC still does not show growth but the market is giving it a multiple of 19 times. Nestle has had at least 9% growth, and the market has been giving it multiples in excess of 50 times. So, rather than slicing it between largecaps and midcaps, it is better to slice basis growth.


Coming to pharma stocks, we have seen a decent buying interest in select names from Dr Reddy’s to Glenmark and even Aurobindo Pharma despite the overhang. Are there any select pharma stocks that you are looking at?The market is not comfortable with stocks which have got higher exposure on the US market, especially in the case of Aurobindo Pharma. The share of the US market to their business is going to go up to about 58 odd per cent. That is why the stock is trading at 8 to 9 multiple. Other players like Dr Reddy’s are panning out better largely because they are looking to diversify their geographies. 

Domestically, hospitals have done fairly well in the last quarter and their EBITDA margin is improving. Given that the capex is behind us, we also like the MNC pharma companies which have got higher domestic exposure. Growth certainty is definitely there along with some of the companies are witnessing good amount of margin expansion. Take for example Pfizer. It witnessed about 400 bps kind of margin expansion and which is why even some of these MNC names are trading 40 times, their current earnings even slightly more than that. Wherever we are getting any comfort in terms of stable growth, those are the stocks one has to chase.


What have you made of the recent run-up in some of the metal names? Would that be a pocket you would be willing to look at or you would still be averse to?In metals, this rally has been largely driven by the idea that the US and China are going to strike a deal. We think some bit of technical bounce can be expected. But then, the structural issue of demand supply in balance globally is still sort of persisting and that is where we see challenges. 


Within tier I names, we like Tech Mahindra more, given the fact that the deal wins have been pretty good in the last quarter.-Pankaj Pandey
Domestically, we expect that the inventory correction has happened and you have seen raw material prices correcting. So EBITDA per tonne is likely to improve for some of the players but then one should not be overtly bullish on a number of these names. We still have a good amount of clouds and we would not expect much performance. This rally does not have too many legs.


Does one look at Zee in a new light altogether now?The only positive in Zee is that you will not see pledged shares coming into the market. But there is the overhang of related party transactions. I guess the amount is about Rs 700 odd crore which is what the company had given to launch Dish TV. That remains a challenge because Dish TV itself is stressed. This is a key overhang and which is why we have turned neutral on the stock. Till the time that gets resolved, we would not expect a rerating to happen. Recently, what we have seen is that even the growth has come down because of the overall slowdown that we have witnessed in the economy. Till the time, related party transactions get resolved, we will not be turning positive on the stock.


Do you feel that perhaps now we might see a catch up and if so, which are the select names within the IT pack? Would you be looking at Wipro or Infosys to lead the way forward?In IT, the growth has been on expected lines. There is not much of positive surprise to look at on IT side. But within tier I names, we like Tech Mahindra more, given the fact that the deal wins have been pretty good in the last quarter. That is something which we like at this point in time. 


How should pharma be approached? After the US FDA booster for Biocon, is there merit in the stock?We like the entire Biocon story. In H1, they made revenues of about $140 million on biologics and they have got about 28 products in the pipeline and are confident of achieving a billion dollar revenue by FY22. Given the capex the company has been doing and the initial success it has seen, we have a target price of Rs 310. Within the tier I pharma names, Biocon clearly stands out. Their subsidiary Syngene is also doing quite well. We are quite positive on this stock. 

Largely we are more positive on the domestic oriented names whether it is Torrent Pharma which has got a higher share of domestic revenues or the MNC names or even the hospitals, wherein we are seeing structural improvement in margins, given the fact that capex is over. We are not chasing companies which are pretty aggressive on the US market."

Let me start by sharing marvelous quotes from two investment greats.


Reversion to mean is the iron rule of the financial markets
-- John C Bogle

The safest and most potentially profitable thing is to buy something when no one likes it

- Howard Marks
Individually too, these are great quotes, but together, they are something else. If just these two pithy advices are followed, we need to read no voluminous treatise on investing, and we will do quite well as investors.

It is vital that we, as investors, know at what stage of the cycle a company and its stock price are. This applies to different market segments as well. Just a couple of years ago, there was a lot of optimism about midcap stocks. There were cases when investors had a disproportionately high share of their portfolios allocated to midcap stocks.

This happened simply because these stocks did very well in the preceding few years. Indeed, we still get many queries whether midcap stocks are better than largecaps in delivering alpha.


Agencies
The fact is, that over time, largecap and midcap indices have given almost the same returns, but they move in different trajectories.

The same swings in fortunes apply to sectors and individual stocks. It also applies to portfolio managers with different styles. Only the length of the cycle varies.

Just compare the long-term track records of different funds. Inevitably, they converge to a similar performance.

Why is this relevant? Investing in a stock, after it has risen substantially, and with the hope or belief that one can get out just before the slide sets in is one of the primary causes for investor heartburn.

When the market price suggests the level of optimism around a stock is substantial, it is better to stay away from it.

This rule applies to all companies, including the ones where the earnings momentum continues to be robust. As investors, apart from tracking the earnings trajectory of the company concerned, it is vital that we keep track of the entry price when we buy its shares.

For example, let us discuss one of the most well-known companies in the country: Infosys. Between 2000 and 2006, it grew earnings by 35.7 per cent compounded per annum. But during the same period, the stock rose only 4.2 per cent per annum.

The same Infosys grew earnings between 2017 and 2019 at 6.42% compounded per annum. But the stock price moved 16% compounded per annum in those years ending October 2019. (Source: ACE Equity).


Agencies
What is the crucial difference? The entry price in March 2000 was at a PE multiple of 208 times trailing earnings. In August, 2017, the entry price was at a trailing PE of 14 times.

Almost every sector and stock is subjected to this rule, including very well-known and popular names of the day.


Agencies

Agencies
Here is the history of PE multiples of Nestle India and Hindustan Unilever (HUL), two most popular names in the market today:



Nestle’s earnings growth was far ahead of price growth during 1994 and 2004. But since then, the stock price growth has far outstripped earnings growth. However, over the long term, there is a definite correlation between earnings growth and price growth.



HUL’s share price has exhibited a similar trajectory like that of Nestle in the past decade. However, in the long run, there is a definite correlation between earnings growth and price growth.


What are the implications for an investor?


Never overload your portfolio with a single type of stocks or a single type of mutual funds. Always diversify. This would help when the sector or stock reverts to mean.



It is okay, even desirable, to have some sectors or stocks (provided they have strong business models) that are down in the dumps. That way, all our investments need not go up and down together.



When one stock or sector is very popular today, it reflects the high level of expectation around that stock or sector. A very high expectation almost inevitably leads to disappointment. The key to making money is to buy good businesses when they are not popular and wait for them to turn popular. When they are unpopular, they aren’t expensive. And buying something inexpensive increases the chances of a profitable investment.

Just as we began with two great quotes, we shall end with another. Graham and Dodd’s immortal book Security Analysis begins with this quote from Horace, which we shall do well to remember always:


Many shall be restored that are now fallen, and many shall fall that are now in honor!

(EA Sundaram is Executive Director and CIO for Equities at O3 Capital. Views are his own)"
27,2019-11-28,Nestle,"Do not look at industry, look at dividend paying as a criteria for midcaps because that will qualify all the decent companies in the bucket and you can then pick and choose, says Ajay Srivastava, CEO, Dimensions Corporate Finance Services. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


It is raining dollars, approximately worth Rs 40,000 crore, in the last three months. With so much liquidity, bulls cannot put a foot wrong. I thought markets always followed earnings, macro and the long term economic outlook. Why are foreign investors blinded to what is happening in the real economy?It is important to understand that in economic text books, we never had a concept called negative interest rate. This is a concept where I give you money and take back less money after one year. This is an unheard of economic concept. When you unleash that kind of stuff on the global economy, you are bound to have people taking risks of all kinds. It does not matter anymore because even if you do nothing, but keep getting some dividend; even if you do nothing but get 1-2% return, you are good enough from that basis. 

We have seen this play out in a number of times. It is not the first time that the liquidity rally has played out. Unfortunately, India is different from the US and you are right in questioning this because compared to the US, where the economy is also doing extremely well, grounds up we are doing pretty badly. But the caveat is that though we could be doing very badly at the ground level, the top-tier companies have got a big largess in terms of tax. 

If you remember the finance minister’s speech yesterday, there is a reference to a dividend distribution tax. The next Budget might take off the dividend distribution tax and so the listed large corporates will definitely benefit from the economic policy and the FIIs are going in there. The fact that the rest of India wants to party with everybody else is a different matter, but the key is economic policies of the government, global flows are marching together and taking the index up. You ride it because the government is with you at this point of time.


Let us try and map it and track it to the top. What stocks could you bet on which will make you richer in say a year or two from now?I am a firm believer of the trodden path, I do not really venture into jungles and get lost. The last time we tried it was three years back. Believe me, we just managed to get out of the jungle alive -- small and midcap space. So, I would still stay on the trodden path. The government economic policies are very clearly saying that large private corporate banks will continue to benefit. 

We have a big power debt overhang on the nationalised bank and they may give you a little bit of fillip but eventually the chicken will come home to roost because power dues are going to turn into a big problem in the next 6-9 months. Nationalised banks are going to be an issue and the consumer and mudra loans will be written off again. Unless the nationalised banks are privatised and in which case you can buy it, I would say follow closely the path of the private banks. They are doing fine, they have a monopoly. 

Pharma sector which has underperformed for some time, is ready for a big jump because they sorted out a lot of US issues. The domestic industries are doing well and there is no sign of price control. Corporate tax rate is going to give them some benefit; if dividend distribution tax goes, that is going to be big benefit. 

The last one would be metals. That is also slated for a big bump because if the economy stabilises and growth returns, they are the first point where the demand has to come in. I would say, take the metal, pharma, and the private banking space. You are doing fine with your portfolio at this point of time.


How many more private banking names would you buy? Would you really touch a YES Bank and RBL right now? How much more of ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank would you hold in your portfolio?Okay two points; one, historically one does not buy returns at the peak, you buy risk at the peak. When you are investing big time, you are investing more on risk than return because it is a liquidity filled rally and has nothing to do with fundamentals. So, it may come to haunt you for a long time. The only benefit is that even if there is a steep correction in the market or whenever global liquidity starts to ebb, or we have a high inflation in India, you would find that they will be the last point standing in terms of these four-five institutions. 

If you were to be in this market, you got to be there because literally a telecom and four banks have a monopoly on the private sector space in India which is unprecedented in global industry at this point of time. You can keep buying safer, but we are buying risk at the end of the day. You might have to wait for the return longer, but let us not worry about whether they will be a buyer in those stocks because those have been tested in the last five, seven years. We have tested HDFC Bank and of course there is a leadership change which might change a lot of views about the bank, but so far on the fundamentals, we have had phenomenal returns on these banks. If you have stuck to Nestles and Levers of the world, you would have phenomenal returns. 

I would say do not worry about largecap surplus, do not add too much. It is a risk right now but don’t worry too much because these stocks can go a long way.


You will get returns in all sectors but metal would give you perhaps the best alpha returns as the economy turns around.-Ajay Srivastava

If one works with the assumption that recovery will happen -- be it at the end of this year or next year, as base has come down to a sub-5% GDP growth, where would the delta of recovery be higher? Would it be in consumption, autos, discretionary and durables or will it be in cyclicals, metals, cement or industrials? Which end of the market do you bet on?You are assuming that there is a direct connection between the state of the economy and the state of the capital markets. The state of the economy is nowhere in comparison to the state of the market and that is why those two issues have to be delinked. Large parts of India will suffer and is already suffering in terms of the economic progress, growth, employment, etc. 

But there will be a part of India which will benefit from the government policies and that is why we need to divorce sentimental thinking from low GDP numbers. The top 200 companies in the country are having a much better time with lack of competition and all other governance issues and all economies put together than perhaps ever in the history. The more the smaller shoemakers disappear, the more the Batas gain. The more the smaller condiment makers disappear, the more Nestle gains. 

Secondly, who gains from the cut in the tax rate? The answer is the top 200 companies. The smaller guys never paid the tax because they were anyway losing money. I would say fundamentally that you need to divorce the economic aspect from the capital market. They are too far apart at this point of time. And they may be playing out in political compulsions and the results in state assembly election, etc. We may not like it, but that is what it is. 

I believe today in terms of pure market, metals will be the outperformers at any point of time because given where they are today and the fact that most of them are debt-free at this point of time but at the low end of the earning cycle, with very low price to book, you just cannot go wrong in terms of doubling or tripling. Decent metals stocks will go at least to 1.5 to 2 times book value. Metal would be the first stage where we will get alpha returns in my view. You will get returns in all sectors but metal would give you perhaps the best alpha returns as the economy turns around.


Do you buy a pure India play like SAIL, a global interplay like Vedanta or a Europe plus India interplay like Tata Steel? It is a large sector and in India there are a variety of metal companies, ferrous and nonferrous. What would you bet on?We are already placing our bets on two places. One is the non-ferrous. There are only two or three companies and you really do not have too much choice in the non-ferrous. There is a Nalco, a Vedanta and that is about all. We have holdings in both. 

But steel could be a stunner because now steel is in very strong hands. All the players are in very strong hands. There is no need for discount in the market. The debt overhang is gone by and large from the sector. It should get some amount of government largesse in terms of orders or some concessions. 

Non-ferrous and steel in that order would be the better plays and as a pure India story, I do not bet on global stories because if I have to bet on global stories, I would go abroad and bet. I am not betting on metal overseas. I am betting local on India at this point of time because if any revival takes place, you need more aluminium windows, more steel, more iron railway tracks. You need all kind of stuff. Without that, it is not going to work for the India story. I would say non-ferrous first, steel second and local domestic at this point of time.


Given that valuation discount of midcaps is close to a 10-year high, does that present a compelling opportunity? What are the businesses you would be looking at within the midcaps?You have to focus on high dividend paying companies because those are the companies with steady businesses, low debt and ability to pay big amounts of money back to the shareholders. In fact. in some of the cases the returns are 7-8 and even 10%. 

So instead of looking at an industry pack, you need to look at the divided pack of midcaps and say if the company can pay 5-7-8% dividend consistently on strong cash flows and since there is no capex need for any company in the next year or two, that is the segment you can focus on. I would say, do not look at industry, look at dividend paying as a criteria for midcaps because that will qualify all the decent companies in the bucket and you can then pick and choose. 


Because midcap and dividend normally does not come together? Yes, you are right but this is a peculiar situation, where you find many midcaps giving dividend yields of 8-10% even at this point of time. That is why I said it is one of the peculiar times of life where midcaps are not borrowing, they are not doing capex.

By definition, Rs 500 crore, Rs 1000 crore companies can be midcaps because of SEBI definition. You will find that they are giving very attractive dividends at this point of time. Their share prices have fallen dramatically but the cash flows are very good at and they are mostly deleveraged or are in the process of deleveraging. 


I cannot find companies which are giving 8% dividend yield with market cap criteria of less than Rs 1000 crore. Maybe you have some different data, why don’t you educate us?We have got midcaps which are giving us yield of between 5-10%. Definitely we have got at least 8 to 10 of them in our portfolio at this point of time. I can tell you one off the cuff itself. If you look at HEG -- Rs 50 dividend, Rs 1,000 share price. It was Rs 950 share price not long back.


HEG must have given this dividend when they were in a bull run because there was a shortage of graphite electrodes. That was last year. It is like buying a commodity cycle when the year was great. The dividend was strong, may be that dividend would not come now?It has come this year. Earlier, these companies were leveraged. So, when they were getting into a cycle, they were over investing even at the peak of the cycle. Now, the midcap story is that they have enjoyed the peak of the cycle, they have deleveraged themselves, not invested too much capex in the market and therefore are able to come out smiling at the end of the day. 

That is why I said there is a qualitative difference in the top 200 midcaps which have not invested at the peak of the cycle, but used the cash flows to deleverage themselves and clean the books of the company. Take REC for instance. I would call it a midcap. It’s dividend is upwards of 8-10% if I am not wrong. Portfolio may go wrong in the next two years or so, but the dividend has been extremely strong."

29,2019-11-30,Nestle,"MUMBAI: To de-tangle growth from the grip of a slowdown, fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies are redefining their product and marketing strategies, depending on their stage of evolution.

Hindustan Unilever (HUL), which is already well entrenched in both urban and rural India, has maintained its strategy of straddling the pyramid. Urban-centric company L’Oreal, on the other hand, is looking at a more premium play and has put the sachet strategy on the back-burner. There are some like Nestle India that have a greater emphasis on urban market (75% of its sales) than rural, and are looking to strengthen its portfolio mix with a clear focus on the core.

In an exclusive interview with TOI, Nestle India CMD Suresh Narayanan said three factors will define the texture of consumption going forward. One is the mix of the portfolio which companies enjoy between super-premium, premium and mainstream products. “We will be expanding, but will be judiciously combining premiumisation with more mass-oriented products,” said Narayanan.

The second factor is the demand for a variety of products that consumers seek at different occasions.

“That’s what we played to with the aggressive innovation/renovation programme that we’ve had on 61 products in the last three years. That’s about three times what we were innovating before. The pace of innovation is going to play an important part,” said Narayanan.

Third is consumer-centricity of a brand. Those companies, said Narayanan, which are more consumer-centric and anticipate products that consumers might need are ultimately going to win the game with their agility and responsiveness. “Today’s consumer, whether rural or urban, is seeking not just good price value but also trustworthy and sustainable quality. Consumers are looking at brands that are relevant to them. 

That’s a journey that companies need to traverse. So simply because your brand has been around for 50 years, in a particular format or price point, speaking a particular language, is not enough,” said Narayanan. Nestle India bucked the slowdown and declared a domestic revenue growth of 10.5%, which was better than its peers, in September quarter.

A number of companies are said to be going back to focusing on the core. L’Oreal India, which had ventured into low-unit-price packs a few years ago, has withdrawn the sachet strategy. “Sachets are not part of our strategy,” L’Oreal India MD Amit Jain told TOI recently, adding, “We are focused on the premium play.”

Narayanan said it is not going to be a quick slope up. Narayanan said, “Equally, if you have to kick-start consumption, then we have to either put more money directly in the hands of people or indirectly through a tax effect.”"

2,2019-12-04,Nestle,"NEW DELHI: If a low price-to-earnings (PE) ration gives you comfort while buying stocks, market performance this year might puzzle you.

Investors are chasing high PE stocks in recent times, pushing stock prices higher, thanks to growth visibility and next-to-nil governance issues.

And analysts are not worried. They expect many of these performing counters to sustain their high valuations. 

This was visible in the top gainers of BSE200 basket this year. Data showed 32 BSE200 stocks jumped between 30 and 125 per cent this calendar despite having an average PE of 50. Twenty-three of the 32 stocks have trailing 12-month PEs of 40 or more, data compiled from corporate database Ace Equity suggests. 

Info Edge, which commands a PE of 84, has jumped 74.41 per cent this calendar. Drug maker Abbott India has climbed 67.75 per cent even at a PE of 51.1. In case of Info Edge, the industry average PE stands at 53.3, AceEquity data suggests. In the case of Abbott India, the industry PE is 26.5.

JM Financial said it is positive on the Info Edge as the core businesses have delivered superior performance consistently. It noted that the business of 99acres reported over 20 per cent growth in billings in September quarter, even in a weak underlying market. The brokerage sees more upside on the stock.

In case of Abbott, ICICIdirect cited the drugmaker’s strong growth track in power brands and capability of new launches on a fairly consistent basis – 100 products in the last 10 years – to justify a ‘buy’ rating.

It noted that the company has maintained dividend payout of 35 per cent in the past four years, with cash/share of Rs 793 in FY19.

Berger Paints and Bajaj Finance have soared 50 per cent each this calendar. While Bajaj Finance commands a PE of 48 times, Berger Paints enjoys a PE of 77. The paint's industry PE currently stands at 64.1. For Bajaj Finance, the industry PE is 25.3.

Post its Q2 results, JP Morgan said Bajaj Finance’s numbers are positive. It said while it took note of the punchy valuation, it felt they can sustain as the NBFC continues to deliver sector-beating loan and EPS growth and ROEs.

The same is not the case with Berger Paints. Emkay Global said while it sees good earnings visibility, valuations at 58 times FY21E EPS are expensive and the stock’s 15 per cent premium over Asian Paints looks unjustified.

Whirlpool of India, which has a PE of 56.4, has surged 56 per cent. Analysts are positive on this stock, but sees limited upside after the recent jump.

Among others, Bata India, Nestle India and Varun Beverages are some other high PE stocks that have performed well this year. 

Bata’s Q2 numbers showed margin improvement on a YoY basis for the 14th successive quarter.

“Although near-term valuation seems to have peaked, the company is well-placed in the sector, which has a big opportunity size. We believe it can be a good buy for the long term,” Edelweiss Professional Research said in a note.

Steward & Mackertich has initiated coverage on Varun Beverages with a ‘Strong Buy’ recommendation, valuing the stock at 30 times its CY2021 EPS.

Meanwhile, PI Industries has rallied 76 per cent so far this calendar. The stock trades at 45.3 times its trailing 12-month earnings per share.

“It would be too much to hope for investors to suddenly worry about super-rich valuations of growth or quality stocks,” Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note.

In a recent study on BSE100 stocks, Marcellus Investment Managers found that there is no significant correlation between starting period valuations and subsequent long-term returns.

Instead, in each of the historical phases, there has been a strong correlation between earnings growth rates and share price returns, the study concluded.

Shares of AMCs HDFC AMC and RNAM have rallied 125 per cent and 121 per cent, respectively, this year. Their PEs stood at 61.6 per cent and 41.1 per cent, respectively, and EV/Ebitda at 43.3 and 28.9.

Adani group stocks Adani Transmission and Adani Gas have gained 62-67 per cent this calendar with PE values of 46.6 and 55.6, respectively."

5,2019-12-09,Nestle,"Valuations of FMCG stocks have finally started correcting, with prices falling between 3 per cent and 12 per cent in the past one month as compared with the marginally positive returns on the Nifty.

On an average, shares of FMCG companies are currently trading 15 per cent below their yearly highs as foreign portfolio investors reduced their positions on the sector, citing expensive valuations.

According to analysts, earnings outperformance is critical for maintaining premium valuations. However, contrary to Street expectations, demand recovery is rather slow and is likely to take another 2-3 quarters, as per management commentary across FMCG companies.

Stocks such as Godrej Consumer, Gillette India, ITC, Marico, Colgate-Palmolive, Bajaj Consumer, Hindustan Unilever and Glaxosmithkline Consumers have declined between 5 per cent and 12 per cent in the past one month. Nifty FMCG index has shed nearly 4 per cent in this period. Nifty 50 has gone up marginally, 0.07 per cent.



“With margin expansion likely to be at a slower pace, it is critical for the FMCG companies to drive top-line growth to match Street expectation of sustained, healthy, and double-digit earnings growth,” said Nitin Gupta, analyst, SBICAP Securities.

“Another factor safeguarding the premium sector valuations despite the recent slowdown is the TINA (There Is No Alternative) effect. Given the current steep valuations, FPIs have continued to trim their positions in the sector,” he added.

Colgate, Britannia, Dabur, Godrej Consumer and Marico are currently trading about 40 times their FY21 estimated earnings, while HUL and Nestle are trading at PEs of 51 and 59 times.

The sector is considered defensive, which means FMCG are in high demand in falling markets. The sector is struggling to boost growth. Stocks such as Godrej Consumer, Dabur, Marico, Emami and Bajaj Consumer have seen earnings downgrades in the past one month.

“With macroeconomic headwinds worsening, demand and consumer sentiments have aggravated sequentially. This, coupled with liquidity challenges, exerted pressure on the trade pipeline inventory,” said Abneesh Roy, analyst, Edelweiss Securities. “This, we believe, would lead to the softest volume growth in Q2FY20, a nine-quarter low.”

Stocks such as ITC, Gillette, and Godrej Consumer are currently trading 20 per cent below their respective 52-week highs. Britannia and Marico are down by 15 per cent, while Hindustan Unilever, Dabur, GalxoSmithkline Consumer have declined over 6 per cent from their yearly highs.

However, some analysts believe that the current slowdown is not structural and is likely to see a rebound in the medium term as the effect of central government initiatives matures."

10,2019-12-11,Nestle,"MUMBAI: The economy may be slowing down, but not the entry into the ‘million dollar CEO club’, which saw a record 22 new members in FY19.

The number of CEOs earning a million-dollar (Rs 7 crore) salary annually surged to 146 from 124 in the previous year — an 18% jump. This is by far the best fiscal for the elite club in the last four years despite the falling rupee. The club with 119 members in FY16 had seen a marginal membership growth till FY18.

According to the annual study of CEO/CXO compensation in BSE 200 companies by EMA Partners, commissioned by TOI, the overall pay of the million dollar CEO club increased 14% to Rs 2,457 crore from last year’s Rs 2,158 crore, with the average CEO package at Rs 16.8 crore. For the study this year, the value of the rupee to the US dollar was taken at Rs 70. In the previous year, the threshold to the club was Rs 6.5 crore (the rupee to the dollar was pegged at Rs 65). So the cut-off in annual compensation — Rs 7 crore — required to figure in the elite million dollar CEO club got tougher this year.




The club features prominent promoter and professional CEOs such as Sun Group chairman Kalanithi Maran, who leads the group with a compensation of about Rs 88 crore, Hero MotoCorp CMD Pawan Munjal (Rs 80 crore), JSW Steel chairman Sajjan Jindal (Rs 69 crore), Larsen & Toubro CEO & MD S N Subrahmanyan (Rs 27 crore), Indiabulls Housing Finance VC & MD Gagan Banga (Rs 16 crore), Nestle India CMD Suresh Narayanan (Rs 11 crore), Marico MD & CEO Saugata Gupta (Rs 9 crore), among othersAmong the new entrants to the club, Infosys CEO Salil Parekh received the biggest jump of over 300% in compensation to Rs 17 crore in 2018-19, from about Rs 4 crore in the previous fiscal. 

Professional CEOs (85 of them) have clearly outpaced promoter CEOs (61), and this gap has only widened over the years. “Hiring a good CEO in India just got tougher as India Inc sees more exit barriers in place now in the form of short-term and long-term compensation,” said EMA Partners regional managing partner (Asia) K Sudarshan. He added that the numbers have risen in line with the deepening market.

Although the economy is facing a slowdown, Sudarshan said its effects will be more visible in terms of bonuses and commissions payable to CEOs. In any case, these are numbers for FY19, and the real impact of a slowdown will be seen in CEO salaries of FY20. Over the last few years, CEO salaries have come up for criticism in certain sections of society. Some leaders of India Inc have seen their annual compensations remain unchanged this year, such as the Marans, while for others it has come down, like in the case of Onkar Kanwar of Apollo Tyres. However, experts believe with growing demands on CEOs, the salary paid to the occupants of the corner office is justified. 

Nestle India CMD Suresh Narayanan, who is credited with bringing Maggi out of the crisis it faced a few years ago, said he does not entirely work for the salary that he earns. “It’s not that this (compensation) is going to influence the way in which I contribute. When you reach the level of a CEO, there are other reasons that inspire you to work. To me, pay has to reflect the skills to manage the complexity, the challenges, the accountability and the responsibility that a person carries,” he said. Narayanan said in the Indian context, the governance responsibilities in a publicly-listed company are quite high and thus if a CEO is being remunerated in consonance with the expectations of an organisation, then it is fair to give him/her whatever is deemed to be fair by that organisation. “Ultimately, you want CEOs to add value as well. One of the measures is the share price that they deliver for investors. Those who have delivered strongly on that at least have added value to somebody rather than just taking a salary. If the principles of accountability, responsibility, skill, talent and value addition are counted in and then people are paid, it’s fine,” said Narayanan.

Concurring with Narayanan,Marico MD & CEO Saugata Gupta said it’s not the money that attracts people to the post. “I want to leave a legacy behind. What drives me is the sheer adrenaline and the new learnings one gathers in this journey as CEO,” he said. Experts said if one were to look at broad benchmarking in the global context, the expectation from an emerging market player is high growth, and that clearly justifies the compensation CEOs get in India.

Sudarshan said the numbers no longer raise eyebrows and any attempt to stifle or muzzle compensation is not in the best interests of the organisation and its shareholders. What is a matter of concern for India Inc is the number of women at the top. Women CEOs form only 2% of the million dollar CEO list this year. “This continues to be a grave challenge and we are seeing that many companies are proactively taking steps to ensure diversity at all levels and we will hopefully see a big difference over a period of time. There’s no magic bullet for this issue,” said Sudarshan."
11,2019-12-12,Nestle,"NEW DELHI: The National Antiprofiteering Authority (NAA) has charged FMCG major Nestle India of profiteering from cut in goods and services tax (GST) rate and slapped about Rs 90-crore penalty, giving the company three months to comply.

The authority has also directed the company to reduce prices ‘commensurately’ and mandated that the Director General Anti-Profiteering (DGAP) issues a showcause notice seeking explanation on why the penalty should not be applied.

The DGAP has been directed to furnish compliance report in four months.

“It is evident from the narration of facts that the respondent has denied the benefit of tax reduction to the customers in contravention of the provisions of the Section 171(1) of the CGST Act, and has thus profiteered. Therefore, he’s liable for imposition of the penalty,” the authority said in its order issued on Wednesday.

“Accordingly, the respondent is directed to reduce its prices commensurately in terms of Rules 133(3),” the authority said, adding that a showcause notice be issued.

A Nestle spokesperson in an email statement said, “Nestle India as a responsible corporate citizen has passed on the benefits of GST to consumers and will consider appropriate actions post studying the order by NAA.”

Of the Rs 89.7-crore penalty slapped by the authority, Nestle had previously deposited Rs 16.58 crore with the government last year.

The authority said in its order Wednesday, that the balance amount, along with an 18% tax, be deposited in the consumer welfare funds of central and state governments."

13,2019-12-16,Nestle,"New Delhi: The All India Food Processors' Association (AIFPA), which has members such as ITC, Mondelez, Haldiram, Bikanervala, PepsiCo, Nestle and various small and mid-sized foods companies, has written to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman citing 'anxiety among food industry on the recent proposition for raising GST rates.'

The letter comes just days ahead of a GST Council meeting on December 18. “The industry has been struggling to maintain its operations under severe financial constraints and any increase in GST rates will hit the sector very hard to the detriment of the farmer, industry and Government,” the letter, signed by AIFPA president Subodh Jindal, states. ET has seen a copy of the letter.

Food categories including branded snacks, instant mixes, ready-to eat products, pickles and namkeens are currently are taxed at 12%. “Industry has been constantly requesting you to shift food products currently taxed at 12% to 5%. The government has not so far agreed to this request and now, on the contrary, the industry is faced with the unjust proposal of increasing GST rates,” the letter, dated December 12, reads.



There is widespread speculation that rate increases will be announced at the GST Council meeting on December 18 on diverse categories including processed foods, healthcare services and mobile phones. Presently, all products and services fall under four tax slabs - 5, 12, 18 and 28%. An upward revision of the slabs would help the government mop up additional revenue of Rs 1,000 crore a month.

Domestic consumption of FMCG products, which include foods, has slowed significantly across channels over the past 12 months, especially in rural markets where it fell to a seven-year low in the July-September quarter, at 7.3% by value from 16.2% a year earlier, Nielsen said in a report in October.

The outlook for companies selling everyday household items remains bleak, primarily on account of a distinct slowdown in rural demand owing to lower farm incomes, liquidity crunch, and rising unemployment. GST collections have been lower than expected and the government is looking to boost revenue amid an ongoing economic slowdown.

At a press meet three days ago, Sitharaman maintained that there have been no conversations on tax revisions yet. The Central GST collection fell short of budget estimates by about 40% in the April-November period, according to government data. The letter by AIFPA also says there is “incongruency” in levying 12% GST on branded snack foods compared to 5% for unbranded snack foods. “This anomaly has been increasing complexities for the industry and encouraging production of unsafe, unhealthy products. A shift of consumption from branded to non-branded foods reduces revenue to the government and proves to be counterproductive,” the letter adds. The government’s thinking that foods currently placed at 12% GST are elitist is not true, it said."

17,2019-12-18,Nestle,"We will try and mitigate as best as possible any sharp price increases. However, if the trend continues to be pretty aggressive on prices, as we move forward we might have to selectively look at price increases, says Suresh Narayanan, CMD, Nestle.


How has Nestle fared in a slowing market?Let me take it at two levels; one is at the level of the available published information which is the information put out by Nielsen. They are credible and competent to feel the pulse and to measure the underlying trend in consumption. 

What they have really shown is that in the last quarter, for the first time in many quarters, rural growth has been lower than urban growth and this trend of rural growth and urban growth coming down has been secular for the last couple of quarters.

Clearly, it is biting particular consumption segments, particular categories and particular companies. Having said that, the Nestle performance has been that in the last eight quarters which is up to the end of September quarter, we have had fairly strong volume and mixed growth. In fact, we have had almost double digit domestic sales growth. In a sense, that is the reason why a statement has been made that we have actually bucked this particular trend. 

There are few reasons for it as well. Number one is that our rural play is relatively lower as compared to many of the peer group. We are at about 20 to 25%. It is not inconsiderable but it is not as high as 35% to 40% for some. So, that clearly will be affecting it. 

Number two, our growth in tier two and tier three towns has been very strong. This has continued for quite a few quarters now. That has really helped in terms of keeping our ship going full steam in the situation. 

Number three, there is a convergence of aspirations. Thanks to the information effect, rural India aspirations that are taking place and the amount of advertisements and videos that people in the rural parts are seeing, are therefore seeing better value, better nutrition, better quality, food safety and greater trustworthiness of the brands that they buy. That is playing favourably with a company like Nestle because we have been in the country for a long time. We have established our credentials as a trustworthy high quality and high safety brand.

If consumers made the choice then there is a tendency for them to choose such brands and in all gratitude of that effect taking place, I am a beneficiary of that trend.


When it comes to dealing with the slowdown, at one point we saw a slew of discounts by companies to help boost the sales, especially during the festive season. But we have also seen an upward trend as far as commodity prices (dairy, milk, sugar, wheat etc) are concerned. I want to understand what is the kind of impact that will have and can we expect some price hikes going forward?That is a very good question. Compared to a fairly benign agricultural commodities situation that we had in the last couple of years, today we face a headwind on commodity prices as milk, wheat, sugar prices are increasing. As a company, we see, at our core strategy a penetration led volume growth. If I automatically and without applying any efforts, translate every commodity price increase into a price increase of the product, I will be adversely affecting the fabric of the strategy that we have put forward. 

What we try and do is because of our size and scale, we are looking at buying efficiencies. We have efficiencies in manufacturing and operations. Also, we take a hard look at the lines of the P&L that relate to the kind of arbitrages that we can do. For example, giving more consumer promotions versus giving a better pricing at this point in time would be one of the considerations in some of our categories. We will try and mitigate as best as possible any sharp price increases. However, if the trend continues to be pretty aggressive on prices, as we move forward we might have to selectively look at price increases.


You mentioned 61 launches since 2016. The pace of launches has become three times what you already had. Going by that, what is the product line that one can expect going forward? Secondly, has the slowdown had an impact on the pace of launches considering you have announced another manufacturing plant for Maggi?I always believe that adversity and crisis are opportunities. I am of the opinion that Nestle should engage more during a slowdown rather than get itself into a shell and wait for another day. I have had this experience in the past. I was posted for five years in Egypt during the Arab Spring and we grew at the fastest pace ever for that market in a very difficult, in a very challenging environment.

I believe that innovation and renovation as a core element of our strategy will not change. However, as we keep launching many new products, we have a certain capacity to be able to handle the complexity and the logistics of these launches as we move forward. We have an active process where we also evaluate what is not working and so some will be out and some other products come in its space. 

You will continue to see innovations and renovations but it will be more calibrated because I am a great believer in the fact that you can launch as many products as you want to. Ultimately, some of them have to start contributing significantly to the growth of the company. It is with that intent that we will look at a greater modulation in terms of what we will be doing.


You mentioned that you are looking at new categories and nutrition is one place where you see a lot of potential. What other categories have you identified in terms of growth drivers or where can we expect more experimentation and how attractive is the nutrition space for you?Nutrition is a very key part of who we are as a company. It is not just the nutrition products that we have on the shelves, but initiatives such as Milo for example, is also in the nutrition space. Health sciences is also in the nutrition space. We also have a business in breakfast cereals which is also potentially in the nutrition space.

So, there will be a lot of engagements across the portfolio, enhancing the nutritive value and also enhancing the nutritive content of our products."
18,2019-12-18,Nestle,"Mumbai: Leading FMCG firm Nestle India on Wednesday said it is examining the show-cause notice slapped by the National Anti-profiteering Authority (NAA) for not passing on GST benefits to customers and take the next course of action in due course.

On December 12, the NAA imposed a penalty of Rs 90 crore on Nestle India for not passing on the benefit on rate reduction to consumers.

""I respect the authority for the order they have passed. However, it is very unfortunate that despite all the evidence that we had provided them in terms of changes in grammage, changes in prices that we had effected we received this order,"" company's Chairman and Managing Director Suresh Narayanan told PTI on the sidelines of the CII FMCG summit.

He further said that the company is examining the order and will take the next possible action in due course.

The authority held that Nestles methodology of passing reduction in the tax was 'illogical, arbitrary, and illegal, which has resulted in unfairness and inequality while passing on the benefit of tax reduction'.

""As a company we were transparent. We went to the authority actually voluntarily suo-moto, as we have some part of GST money collected, which we were not able to pass on asking where it could deposit this money. We had also given them the methodology as there is no existing one. We told pragmatically what we can be done in terms of price and grammage change. Yet, they have issued this notice,"" Narayanan added.

He noted that if the products are for Rs 2 and Rs 5 and if the company had to pass benefits of 0.45 paise or 0.55 paise, there is no coinage to pass the benefit.

""We dont have 0.45 paise and 0.55 paise coins. So, how will I be able to pass on these benefits even if I want to. In smaller packs, it is difficult to give the benefit because there is no coinage,"" he said, adding that the company has passed on the benefit on Maximum Retail Price (MRP) or by way of increase in grammage.

Narayanan also said that the company plans to be plastic neutral at least in its Maggi brand this year.

""By plastic neutral, we mean that we will not add extra plastic into the system but re-use the recycled plastic. We are starting with Maggi. We have already set up garbage collection, segregation and disposal plants in Mussoorie and Dharmashala and we are working with the local authorities there,"" he said.

He further said that the company has set a target to use a 100 per cent recyclable plastic by 2025."

19,2019-12-19,Nestle,"Mumbai | Kolkata: Top consumer goods firms including Hindustan Unilever, ITC, Nestle, Britannia and Parle expect consumer demand to recover by the middle of next year, helped by government interventions and improved sentiments in rural areas.

Consumer product sales have been tapering off consistently over the past four quarters, and experts said the low base will also help sales revival.

“Fundamentally nothing has changed in the Indian economy,” said B Sumant, executive director for FMCG at ITC. “There is a growing consumer base.”

He said the current slowdown is “short term hiccups (that) should disappear by second quarter of next year” when the winter crop yield happens, improving rural sentiments. Credit flow from non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) will boost wholesalers, Sumant said.

Unilever, the British-Dutch parent of HUL, cut its sales guidance for the first half of 2020 on Tuesday, mainly due to slowdown concerns in South Asia and West Africa.

India is Unilever’s biggest market by volume and the second largest after the US in terms of revenues.

The maker of Dove shampoo and Lipton tea said it has seen slowdown particularly in rural India that, for the first time in a while, is growing at a slower rate than urban India.

“As we look forward into next year, we are tackling some of the fundamental drivers of growth around refocusing on penetration of our brands, ensuring that we have strong savings programmes into next year to fuel continued steps up in investment,” Unilever chief executive Alan Jope told analysts. “Some of the macro effects will take time to flow through. So generally, it looks as if India will start to come back in the second half of next year,” he said.

In the past decade, sales of branded daily needs in the nation of 1.3 billion people have increasingly relied on growth in the rural hinterland, home to more than 800 million people, whose purchase behaviour is largely linked to farm output. Rural consumption, which accounts for about a third of the market and has been outpacing urban sales, has come under stress due to lower farm incomes and liquidity constraints that have squeezed the wholesale channel.

“There are issues around overall economic growth, agrarian income, impact and outflow in banking


situation,” said Suresh Narayanan, chairman and managing director at Nestle India. “The government has looked at areas like taxation (and) ease of doing business among other things. If some of the measures that the government is contemplating also leads to more money in the hands of consumers, hopefully recovery should happen. For us to enjoy the 8-9% growth of the past, I hope it happens sooner than later,” he said at CII National FMCG Summit themed ‘Growth Wapsi: Revving up FMCG Growth’ in Mumbai on Wednesday.

From 16.2% year-on-year growth during July-September 2018, growth in the overall fast-moving consumer goods market has fallen to 7.3% last quarter, according to market tracker Nielsen, which expects FMCG to growth to come down to 6.5-7.5% during October-December.

Parle Products, makers of Parle-G and Hide & Seek biscuits, said a fullfledged recovery should come by the second or third quarter of next calendar year, but inflation could be a dampener. “We have seen some green shoots post Diwali such as improvement in sales from low single digit to mid-single digit,” said Mayank Shah, category head at Parle Products. “It should reach normal level in another 4-6 months. Inflation is right now the only major concern.”"

21,2019-12-21,Nestle,"KOLKATA | MUMBAI: Consumers may soon have to pay more for daily essentials and packaged food due to a steep rise in input cost, even as companies fear increased price tags could impact demand. Prices of televisions and refrigerators are also set to go up in January.

FMCG firms including Nestle, Parle and ITC said cost of commodities such as wheat, edible oil and sugar have gone up by 12-20%, which could force them to either hike prices or reduce pack sizes. This is in addition to milk prices that were raised earlier this week. In consumer electronics, higher flat-panel prices and increased cost due to new, stringent energy-rating rules are set to drive up the prices of TVs and refrigerators.

“There is input cost escalation across the board,” ITC executive director (FMCG) B Sumant said. “Price hikes are dictated by market leaders and we expect such announcements will come soon.”

Cost pressure for packaged food segments, including biscuits, instant noodles, snacks, frozen food, cakes and readyto-eat meals, comes at a time when consumers are reeling under food inflation, which accelerated to a near-six-year high of 11% in November, led by a surge in vegetable prices.

“There are serious input cost pressures. What we normally try and see is if we can mitigate it through better efficiencies and economies. But in extreme cases, we look at increasing prices because we are cognisant of the fact that as we sharply increase prices, the levels of penetration will also get affected,” said Suresh Narayanan, chairman at Nestle India. “You can do a combination of reducing promotion, increasing prices and better sourcing, but food inflation is here to stay.""



In dairy, price hikes have started. Amul increased milk prices by ?2 per litre across states, while Mother Dairy raised rates by up to ?3 per litre in Delhi-NCR.

Parle Products category head Mayank Shah said the recent cut in corporate tax rates had provided some cushion against margin pressure, but if commodity inflation continued to accelerate, the company could increase product prices. “In normal situation, we would have hiked prices or reduced pack sizes by now,” he said.

Last quarter, HUL reduced prices, which in turn boosted demand for brands including Lux and Lifebuoy. With palm oil, a key input for making soaps, trading at a three-year high, analysts fear the gross margin for personal care firms could erode even though they enjoy good pricing power.

Consumer electronics industry executives said prices of television panels globally had gone up by 15-17%, forcing them to hike prices from January once the new production gets into the market.

Avneet Singh Marwah, CEO of Super Plastronics that sells Kodak and Thomson televisions, said prices will go up by 5-10% from mid-January."
22,2019-12-22,Nestle,"After a weeklong rally that lifted Nifty and Sensex past the psychologically important 12,250 and 41,600 levels, Dalal Street awaits the final week of the calendar with a reshuffle in Sensex constituents, December series F&O expiry and a year-end slowdown in inflows from foreign institutional investors likely to be key guiding factors.

Marketmen will also seek clarity on the US-China trade deal, which was key force behind last week’s surge. The week ahead will be a truncated one as markets will remain closed for Christmas on December 25. 

Here are the key factors that may guide the market through the week ahead:


Sensex rejig: Capital rotation
From Monday onwards, YES Bank, Tata Motors, Tata Motors DVR and Vedanta will move out of Sensex with Nestle India, Titan and UltraTech replacing them. With this reshuffle, the Sensex will have 30 constituents, instead of 31 earlier. The reshuffle will likely trigger some sudden price changes in the above-mentioned stocks, as fund managers, especially of ETFs and index funds that track Sensex, will have to alter portfolios as per the changes. 

Some changes are also going to be effected in a host of other indices like BSE Sensex Next50, BSE500, BSE100, BSE200, BSE150 Midcap index, BSE250 Smallcap index, BSE250 LargeMidcap index, BSE400 MidSmallcap index, BSE100 Largecap TMC, BSE Sensex 50 TMC, BSE Sensex Next 50 TMC, BSE Carbonex and BSE 100 ESG indices from Monday. Some NSE indices like Nifty500, Nifty Smallcap 250 and Nifty MidSmallcap 400 indices will see partial recast with new additions and deletions from December 26. However, these changes are unlikely trigger any major movements.


RBI' Op Twist OMO
On Monday, December 23, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will simultaneously purchase and sell government securities under a special Open Market Operation (OMO) for Rs 10,000 crore each on December 23, 2019, in what has come to be known as Operation Twist. The announcement of the same has already brought down bold yields substantially, helping bank stocks to rally. Market is going to watch Monday's operation keenly.


F&O expiry: Volatility likely
Traders can expect volatility next week as the December series futures and options (F&O) contracts expire on Thursday, December 26. In the current series, the benchmark indices hit record highs. BSE barometer Sensex has added 1.3 per cent till now for the month while the 50-share Nifty advanced 0.99 per cent.



FII inflow: Pause ahead
Traders will continue to trace inflows from foreign institutional investors (FIIs), who have been bullish in recent days. Since the US and China agreed to a trade deal and Boris Johnson won the ‘Brexit Election’ in the UK on December 13, FIIs have poured Rs 5,007.40 crore into Indian equities, according to NSE data. In December so far, the total FII flows stand at Rs 1,163 crore.

Tech view: Nifty charts indecisive
Nifty gained for the fourth straight session on Friday, but formed an indecisive ‘Doji’ candle on the daily technical chart. Analysts, such as Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities, said such a formation in a sideways index range does not offer any significant predictive signal. Other analysts said there are signs of exhaustion in the index, and the NSE barometer could face stiff resistance in the 12,300-350 range after the recent rally.

“The formation of a Head & Shoulder pattern is still intact in Nifty as per the daily timeframe chart. The neckline of this pattern is in the 11,880-900 range. A sustainable move below this area could open up the market to sharp weakness in the days ahead,” he said.




Details of US-China trade deal
Lack of clarity on the contours of the Phase One of US-China deal remain a matter of concern for traders. The market rallied last week on the news that both the countries have finally found some resolution to their trade tussle but lack of clarity on the deal continues to keep markets edgy. 


Sharp rise in Forex reserves
India's forex reserves increased by 5% during the second half of the financial year ended September 2019. They jumped to $433.70 billion as of September against $412.87 in March. This is likely to help sentiment in currency market. Foreign exchange reserves in India averaged $228.46 billion from 1998 until 2019, reaching an all-time high of $453 billion in December of 2019 after hitting a record low of $29 billion in September of 1998.


Global cues: Eyes on the US
On the global front, investors would be eyeing the release of key macro-economic data from the US, starting from Chicago Fed National Activity Index on December 23, followed by Durable Goods Orders, Redbook on December 24, MBA 30-Year Mortgage Rate, Jobless Claims on December 26 and finally EIA Crude Oil Stocks Change and Baker Hughes Oil Rig Count on December 27.




Crude oil gives up gains
Oil prices came down significantly last week after a spike in the wake of the Opec production cuts and the US-China trade deal. But the market now realizes that Opec’s latest production cuts may not support the prices in the long term. There are projections that US oil production will increase in 2020. Plus, there is a lot of uncertainties in the market surrounding the US-China trade deal. Oil prices fell on Friday, but both benchmarks logged a third straight weekly gain. Brent crude futures settled at $66.14 a barrel, down 40 cents, or 0.6%, but marked a weekly rise of around 1.4%. US West Texas Intermediate crude futures settled at $60.44 a barrel, falling 40 cents, or 1.21%, while gaining about 0.6% on the week.


Investors go into holiday mode
Markets in a number of countries across the world will be closed for much of the week for Christmas. Brazil, Germany, Switzerland and a few others will be closed on December 24 while the US, UK and other European markets will close early. Almost all markets across the world will be closed for trading on December 25. A number of markets, including the US, the UK, France, Germany, Australia and Hong Kong, will observe holiday on December 26 as well for Boxing Day.

		}10 geopolitical risks looming over markets in 2020 of 4NextPrevPlay SlideshowKnow Your Risks21 Dec, 2019While many people are making lists of New Year’s resolutions or presents they’d like from Santa Claus, another much more intimidating tally has come out as well.Morgan Stanley Wealth Management has released a list of 10 geopolitical risks looming for markets in 2020 that are “keeping us awake,” according to authors led by Scott Helfstein.Some of the scenarios are all too familiar to investors in a year that’s seen its share of uncertainty -- but is on track to end with most asset classes faring pretty well.Next Be Prepared21 Dec, 2019Here’s the full list, from most to least likely:

1) Democratic World’s Perfect Leadership Storm
2) Emergence of Competing Trade Blocs
3) China’s Political and Economic Landings
4) U.S. Election Volatility
5) European Stimulus Is Day Late and Euro Short
6) Populism, Inequality and Shareholder Primacy
7) Market Positioning for Japanification
8) Cyber and the Risk of AI-vs-AI Warfare
9) Squeezing the Iran Balloon
10) Gene Editing Goes Wrong

“There is never a shortage of events that could weigh on financial markets,” the strategists wrote. “Most years, investors prove resilient and look through these risks to push assets higher.” NextIt's Bizzare21 Dec, 2019Some of the ideas might seem surprising, like gene editing -- but that made the list given things like the news that a researcher in China had tried to immunize babies from HIV. The recent experiments “may involve questions about what it means to be human,” the report said. Next On Familiar Ground21 Dec, 2019Others, like emergence of competing trade blocs and U.S. election volatility, will be familiar to anyone who has been paying attention this year. Indeed, the leadership-storm idea and trade-bloc entry were on the late-2018 list also. The strategists even included a recap of their list from last year.

While in 2017, just four of the 10 items on their list went on to affect markets, the 2018 compilation included three that were “important” for markets and four that were “fairly prescient,” with just three missing the mark. Next"

Bloated tax liability on capital gainsHundreds of taxpayers are believed to have received notices from the income tax (I-T) department whose systems are unable to process the tax returns correctly.

Expert Take

“Investors remained on the sidelines amid absence of fresh triggers from the market in a holiday-shortened week. Auto stocks traded positive ahead of fresh launches due next month while banking stocks witnessed profit booking. There is a growing confidence among investors that the govt will address growth concerns through adequate measures to boost consumption and investment to maintain buoyancy in the market” -- Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.

32,2019-12-25,Nestle,"NEW DELHI: Consumer goods giants ITC, HUL, Marico, Dabur, Haldiram’s and Nestle have met distributors in India and assured them of bringing parity of price, pack size and offers between products being supplied to general trade (kirana stores) and modern sales channels, such as, large departmental store chains and e-commerce.

During a meeting with representatives from the distributor community, senior Marico executives said 80% of its portfolio has been reserved for kirana stores, 15% for both and 5% high-value items are solely for large departmental stores and e-commerce, according to Dhairyashil Patil, national president of the All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation (AICPDF).

Around 4 lakh distributors across India had threatened to de-stock FMCG products in November, alleging discrimination by consumer goods companies between general trade and modern trade/e-commerce platforms. Distributors are used by companies to push their products to more than 1 crore wholesalers and retailers in the $700-billion domestic retail market.

“Large packs, 4kg and 6kg of detergent powder, are being reserved for modern trade and only 1kg packs are given to us. Why would a customer come to us four times a month when he or she can buy a 4kg pack for the whole month? Similarly, even for the most popular brand of coconut hair oil, modern trade is being supplied larger packs by the company,” said a distributor of large FMCG brands."

34,2019-12-26,Nestle,"Once we have some more confidence in the economy, liquidity flows would comr into both equity and debt markets. It is very positive from a liquidity perspective at least for 2020, says Dipan Mehta, Founder & Director, Elixir Equities. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


The liquidity situation has been quite decent in 2019. It has, in fact, been the best year for overseas investors since 2013 with Rs 1 lakh crore pouring into Indian equities from FIIs. Would the liquidity situation continue to remain robust?Absolutely. We are seeing a surge of global liquidity as well as domestic liquidity coming into play and with RBI following an easy money policy, one should expect liquidity to improve. For domestic liquidity flows point of view, there is a bit of confidence issue play over here -- be it is from the investor view point or from the lender side. 

Once we have some more confidence in the economy, we would see liquidity flows coming into both equity and debt markets. It is very positive from a liquidity perspective at least for 2020 and that would be the underlying reason why we should see an economic recovery, following which we will probably see overall improvement in the stock market, especially the side counters which have been broadly underperforming.


Are industrials going to invite interest as we head into the New Year? We have got some strong calls coming in that pocket of the market. Would you look at some interesting picks over there?The industrials would do well because they have been severely impacted by the economic slowdown over the past several quarters or so. From that point of view, cycles eventually will turn. If there is a bearish, recessionary cycle, then there is only so many months or years that it can last. Eventually, it has to turn around. 

From that point of view, industrials should do well going forward. But we would like to place our bets more on the service industry. Some of the larger investment themes could be financialisation of savings or rising domestic consumption, maybe lower interest rates. Some of the beaten down sectors also could come into play like NBFCs or building material or select FMCG companies, especially those impacted by slowdown in rural spending. 

So, that is where we are looking more closely rather than the industrials where even after a recovery, the overall volume growth rates will remain quite tepid. Typically, you want to go for businesses which can grow at least at 15-20% type of top line, bottom line and few industrials match that kind of criteria. From that point of view, remain a little bit underweight on industrials. But there is no denying the fact that in 2020, industrials could see a trading bounce.


Do you think the market will broaden a little bit in 2020 because 2019 was all about the 15-20 odd names which have held the market up? More importantly, is this the time to buy midcaps and if so which ones would you recommend?Everybody is basing their strategies on the rally becoming more broad based and you cannot just have 15-20 stocks driving the index higher. India has much more than that. It is just that there is not adequate earnings visibility for a whole host of stocks. That will come eventually and as I said, apart from whatever actions the government has taken with regards to direct taxation, what RBI has done with regards to monetary policy and various other government actions have taken to reduce stress within the financial sector and economy, will have to be given time to play out. 

As I said, earlier also, every cycle has a time period. It is a finite cycle and we cannot have recessionary trends lasting for decades on end. At some point of time, the law of averages catches up and you will see a smart recovery in the economy as well. When you reach that position, you will find that a whole host of sectors ranging from auto ancillary to cement, building material, FMCG -- suddenly posting double digit top line, bottom line growth rate. Then the operating leverages also may come into play for a few of those sectors and there would be smart improvement in profits. 

It is just that the investor needs to be a bit patient at this point of time. Every economic cycle does turn and this one that we have seen over the past several quarters or so will also turn around and we will go to a higher growth plane. So it is just a matter of waiting game at this point of time and as I said I think from an investment perspective we are looking very closely at some of the beaten down NBFCs, the likes of say L&T Finance or Cholamandalam for that matter and then within the FMCG play we are very positive on Indian FMCG companies which have underperformed significantly -- the likes of Godrej Consumer, Emami or Jyothi Laboratories. 

The investor needs to be a bit patient. Every economic cycle turns and this one will also turn around and we will go to a higher growth plane.-Dipan Mehta

Within the private sector banks, we feel that the likes of IndusInd Bank, RBL, IDFC First may now outperform the likes of HDFC, Kotak as more risk-on-trade comes into play. So the broad strategy we like to follow is that within the sectors whichever sector an investor is bullish on - -the number three, number four players -- will start outperforming the number one, number two players. 

While the last two years was all about buying the leadership companies within the sector, 2020 and maybe even 2021 will be more about buying the stocks which have underperformed the leaders as they try to play catch up. 


We also have been talking a lot about the divestment agenda and the fact that the stake sale in BPCL is now delayed, most likely would not make it pre-budget, If that spills over to FY21, that will bring to light all the fisc worries once again. But with regards to the divestment agenda itself, the likes of BPCL, SCI, Concor had seen a buzz and runup on this news. Will they continue to be top of mind as we head into the New Year?Yes, that is a bit of disappointment but on a longer-term basis, it is better. It is a major step for the country and if the government gets it right, then it will pave the way for many such privatisations taking place. They are treading waters quite carefully over here. This is perfectly fine and fiscal deficits get measured every year end. But at the end of the day, such steps or reforms have long-term implications for fiscal deficits going forward or so. 

It is a nice experiment and we hope that it is successful. That disappointment has more or less got priced in now.


Do you think that the FMCG sector is poised to hold out quite well next year? Are some of the issues behind it now? Are managements acknowledging that there are green shoots already?I would think so. I would not want to be underweight FMCG and within the FMCG space, I am more optimistic on the likes of the companies which have been bearing the brunt of the slowdown, the likes of Godrej Consumer or Emami or Jyothi Laboratories. These companies, Zydus, Cadila have underperformed the broader FMCG market and they are in good categories. Eventually those categories also will start to show double digit growth rates. 

As and when that happens, these companies with stellar track records will start to display good performance going forward. While we are positive on the likes of Hindustan Unilever and Nestle which have been the flagbearers for the FMCG industry, we feel that from a return perspective and a risk return metrics, the Indian FMCG companies may outperform and maybe you could even look at outliers like a Tata Global or a Glaxo Consumer which is getting merged into HUL. These could also do well. 

So, this is a sector which is holding a lot of promise and rural demand cannot remain subdued for as long as it has been. The monsoons have been good, even the winter rains have been good. We are seeing a gradual improvement in the farm gate prices and with these reversals in the elections, again the focus will be to spend more on the rural sector and put more money in the hands of the rural population and all of that should certainly benefit FMCG companies."
38,2019-12-27,Nestle,"Dalal Street analysts expect an average 11 per cent growth in Sensex and 8 per cent expansion in Nifty in the year ahead, as they expect a likely recovery in economic growth to drive the market going forward.

Analysts have an average 2020 year end target of 13,209 for Nifty and 46,050 for Sensex. They also expect the broader market to recover and outperform the benchmark indices in the New Year.

“The Smallcap and Midcap indices should outperform the frontline indices by a wide margin, as relative valuations for them are very attractive currently. A possible recovery in India’s GDP growth rate is likely to induce a lot of enthusiasm among retail investors, who predominantly invest in lower-rung stocks,” said G Chokkalingam of Equinomics Research & Advisory.

In 2019, Sensex returned 15 per cent year to date while Nifty gained 12.45 per cent. The broader market had another bad year, as BSE Midcap index lost 4 per cent and the BSE Smallcap index 9 per cent.

Manav Chopra, Head of Research for Equity at Indiabulls Ventures, is among the most bullish ones on the prospects of the stock market in 2020. He has a target of 54,000 for Sensex and 13,500 for Nifty.



Calendar 2019’s biggest gainers in the Sensex pack included Bharti Airtel (59 per cent), Bajaj Finance (57 per cent), ICICI Bank (50 per cent), Reliance Industries (38 per cent), Kotak Mahindra Bank (36 per cent) and Nestle India (31 per cent), among others.

India Inc will start reporting December quarter numbers from the second week of January. A positive surprise on the earnings front should help bolster the mood on Dalal Street.

Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, has one-year target of 12,600 for Nifty50, with a marginal upside risk to Q3 earnings expectations and actual outcome.


Valuation concernsAfter the rally seen in 2019, the headline equity indices are hovering near record high levels. The 30-share Sensex trades at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of nearly 29 times against its five-year average of 23 times. Likewise, Nifty P/E stands at around 28 against its long-term average of 25.

A few analysts see it as concern going forward.

Suhas Harinarayanan, Head of Institutional Equity Research at JM Financial Institutional Securities, refrained from setting targets for Sensex or Nifty, but said given where valuations are now and the recovery needed to maintain those, a double-digit return in 2020 would be a positive surprise.

Value investor Shankar Sharma in a recent interaction with ETMarkets.com said largecaps are looking extremely stretched in terms of valuation, which defies all logic, whether it is for banks or consumer stocks.

“India is just an amazingly expensive market. Anything that is half-decent is trading at 50 times, 70 times, 80 times earnings, which is not acceptable,” he said."
37,2019-12-27,Nestle,"Everything else you learn about in the text books about trying to find value, alpha, etc, have to be given up. This is a different paradigm, this is a different world of negative interest rates and we need to provide for that, says Ajay Srivastava, CEO, Dimensions Corporate Finance. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


A purist would say this is turning out to be a great year despite the underlying slowdown in the economy, drop in earnings, rise in inflation, crack in bond yields. The Nifty is on course to give a double digit return?We have two people to thank for it. One is the honourable finance minister who in spite of this slowdown, has handed over the corporate tax cut to the top 200 companies which has proved to be a fillip for their profitability. It may not do wonders for the economy, it may in fact be counterproductive for the rest of the economy, but for the stock holding community, those companies -- like HDFC Bank, Kotak, Nestle, Unilever etc -- on the top of the stock picks of everybody, managed to get a huge bonanza. 

Two is global liquidity. But that liquidity would not have been as good compared to the fact that it came in post the tax cut. It all boils down to the fact that in a dwindling pie, the government somehow sliced the pie in the favour of the top 200 companies which are the stock market darlings. All in all, it panned out to be a very good year. It is very simple economics. Poor economy, a bigger slice of the benefits cake for 200 companies and voila! we have a stock market at a historic high!


When an economy or a sector goes through the turmoil, the big get bigger and the small ones find it difficult to survive and the dwarfs evaporate. Are we in for more of the same in terms of market leadership and bent of the economy? It is partly true. Globally, the bigger one are becoming bigger but there is ample room for the smaller ones in terms of their ability to become part of the supply chain to survive and thrive and compete with the bigger guys. That is the beauty of America. 



Here, the reverse is happening. Here, by policy actions, we are making the smaller Therefore. handing out a victory to the bigger guys not because they have become more efficient, nor that they have over invested. It is just that they were bigger and the government at the end of the day gave a much larger benefit to them, compared to the smaller guys. 

So instead of giving a GST cut to say all companies up to Rs 200 crore, we give a tax benefit to the top class! The danger is that as the bottom of the economy hollows out, the sink hole comes in place and can the top hold with the bottom hollowing out? 

For the stock market it is still party as usual because the bigger companies are not going to go anyway down under, but the middle tier segment will it collapse into the sink hole. That could be the worst news for the economy. 

Generally speaking what you said is true but it brought the economy up along with it. Here what is happening is the bottom is sinking and the top guys are being lifted up by the government and that is not the healthiest thing to expand this economic inequality in any country.


I believe more is coming from the government. From where they will bring the money I do not know, but more is coming.-Ajay Srivastava

 Last time we spoke, you were pretty clear that 2020 is going to be a year where one should just hold on to their horses and remain invested. I cannot imagine anything has changed in a couple of weeks. It looks like the room is getting narrow and narrower to hear anything from the government in the budget?Well, stranger things have happened. Who thought the tax cut will come in the middle of the biggest GST squeeze? So, for that matter one cannot take decisions of this kind. Whether it benefits or if it is going to be detrimental in the long run, we do not know. I do not think we should rule out more such steps. The quarter, contrary to what people expected, is going to get worse. All that you are seeing around the country is not exactly helpful for consumer sales or for the economic activity. The dislocations are going to cost us quite a bit of money at the end of the day. 

We can argue about justifiability, non-justifiability etc. I am not going to debate. Fact is all this results in lower economic activity that is the bottom line. As an investor, you have to be ready that in the next two quarters, you are going to look at a very big economic slide. How you manage the portfolios is up to you, but an economic slide is coming our way and in a much bigger way. Oil is at $68, interest rates are not coming down, economic activity is not picking up, consumption is going to be much worse than what we thought in this quarter. You are not looking at a pretty picture. 

Whether the government will panic itself into giving more benefits to some select people, corporates, sectors, segments one cannot rule it out. This is not something which just happens often in an economy and if this quarter goes bad, you can expect next March quarter is going to be significantly worse. I believe more is coming from the government. From where they will bring the money I do not know, but more is coming.


As an investor, what has been the biggest learning from 2019?The biggest learning for 2019 has been a very simple fact that one should not fight the market trend. As much as we love the smaller companies, as much as we love the one and two PE stocks, one needs to hold vision and stay firm and stay clear and go with the economic policy. Everything else you learn about in the text books about trying to find value, alpha, etc, have to be given up. This is a different paradigm, this is a different world of negative interest rates and we need to provide for that.

70 PEs are norm in the game today. In a traditional text, if you say 70 PEs, that is considered stupidity. But that is not stupidity! Nestle will still run at 70 PE for next three years or 60 PE or thereabouts. The biggest learning is recognise the new paradigm, forget the text books."

35,2019-12-27,Nestle,"MUMBAI: India’s grocery consumption basket shrank by an average 5 kg per household in the 12 months ended September from the year earlier, although they spent slightly more overall. Consumers shopped more often but bought less each time, spreading their budgets to ease the financial pinch amid the slowdown, according to a study by Kantar Worldpanel, a global consumer research firm owned by communications and advertising giant WPP.

“The average basket size in (the year ended) September 2018 was 222 kg while it dropped 3% to 217 kg in 2019,” said K Ramakrishnan, South Asia MD at Kantar. “But spends have gone up 2% from Rs 14,724 to Rs 15,015 in the same time frame.”

Most companies increased promotions in 2018 by offering additional grammage or bigger packs while keeping prices intact. However, these could have been withdrawn or normalised in 2019, resulting in divergent value and volume growth trends, companies said. 

“Even if we sold the same number of packs in both years, volume will still show a drop in 2019 as additional grammage will reflect only in the base year,” said B Krishna Rao, senior category head at Parle Products. “Also, there could be a shift from large packs to smaller ones, which impacts volume growth.”



India’s economy expanded 4.5% in the September quarter, the slowest in more than six years, pulled down by manufacturing, which contracted 1% in gross value added against a 6.9% increase a year earlier. Consumer goods have been hit by stress in rural demand — which accounts for about a third of the market and has been outpacing urban sales — due to lower farm incomes and liquidity constraints that have squeezed the wholesale channel.

“There are issues around overall economic growth, agrarian income, impact and outflow in the banking situation,” Nestle India chairman and managing director Suresh Narayanan told ET last week.

Steps by the government to revive the economy could have a knock-on effect on consumption.

“The government has looked at areas like taxation (and) ease of doing business among other things,” Narayanan said. “If some of the measures that the government is contemplating also leads to more money in the hands of consumers, hopefully recovery should happen.” In a trend reversal, edible oil, tea, spices, snacks and atta, among others, have seen a shift to branded products from the unorganised market. The items cited above have seen a 5% decline in unbranded products even as the overall categories grew. Branded products account for less than half the overall consumption of many commoditised segments. Local and unbranded products, which are cheaper, have been nibbling away at the share of leading consumer product companies for years. Kantar data also revealed that in categories that have at least 50% penetration, consumers have started buying them on two extra occasions during the year but in smaller quantities each time.

43,2019-12-30,Nestle,"NEW DELHI: Following a volatile session on Dalal Street, BSE benchmark Sensex ended marginally lower while its counterpart Nifty eked out small gains. Bank and IT stocks were the top drags, while index heavyweights such as RIL, HDFC Bank and Maruti Suzuki lent some support.

Interestingly, the market breadth leaned in favour of the buyers, indicating underlying bullishness in the market. The advance-decline ratio on BSE stood close to 3:2.

The broader market fared better than benchmarks with BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices, ending 0.29 per cent and 0.75 per cent higher, respectively.

BSE barometer Sensex ended at 41,558, down 17 points or 0.04 per cent while NSE Nifty closed at 12,255.85, up 10.05 points or 0.08 per cent higher. 

Mixed global market sentiment and crude at three-month high kept investors on the sidelines.


Market at a glance
In the 30-pack Sensex, 18 stocks ended in the green and 12 in the red. ICICI Bank, State Bank of India, TCS, Asian Paints and Axis Bank were among the top losers on the index.

Meanwhile, Hero MotoCorp, Nestle India, M&M, Bharti Airtel and Tata Steel were the top gainers, rising up to 1.47 per cent.

In the BSE sectoral space, five out of 19 sectors ended in the red with BSE IT leading the charge, down 0.29 per cent. BSE Auto, up 1.36 per cent, was the best sectoral performer. Auto stocks gained ahead of the release of the auto sales numbers for December, slated to be out on January 1. BSE Metals, up 1.25 per cent, was the second-biggest gainer in the BSE sectoral landscape.


Expert Take:
Market was rangebound, premium valuation and lack of fresh triggers influenced investors to take a cautious approach on heavyweights. But reasonable valuation of midcaps and smallcaps attracted inflows leading to outperformance in the broader market. We expect this polarised valuation not to sustain as there could be a shift of money from the overvalued largecaps to midcaps in 2020.

In its last rebalancing of the 2010s, India’s benchmark index dropped the ailing Yes Bank Ltd., which has lost 74% of its value this year.

Despite enduring a period in which India’s banks faced some of the worst bad loans among major economies, Yes Bank’s fall from favor is an exception among the country’s large private sector banks. The weightings of financial industry stocks on the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex doubled this decade, with investors eyeing growing demand for credit in Asia’s third largest economy. Their high weight is also due to regulations that pushed banks to increase their free-float market cap.

“Financials have had a dominant phase in the last few years on the index, partly because other sectors have struggled,” said Dharmesh Kant, head of retail research at Indianivesh Securities Ltd. “In the next decade we’ll see things changing with more weightage for sectors like metals, infrastructure, consumer durables and FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods).”

While financials will probably maintain the top spot on the index for some time in the 2020s, consumer-oriented firms are likely to grow in heft. In the same rebalance that saw Yes Bank’s departure from the Sensex, jewelry and watch-maker Titan Co. and food manufacturer Nestle India Ltd. were added.

“Retail and FMCG are getting bigger, and as the rising consumption trend continues, you can expect more consumer-oriented companies to enter indices,” said Karthikraj Lakshmanan, a fund manager at BNP Paribas Asset Management in Singapore. “India has many sectors and companies that are emerging and becoming winners. Someone who is able to identify those trends should be able to create alpha.”"
